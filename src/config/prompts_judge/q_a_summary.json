Your mission is to read the entire transcript provided and critically evaluate a <SUMMARY> content based on \"EVALUATION CRITERIAS\" listed below.\n\n##INSTRUCTIONS\n1.Read through the <Q_A_TRANSCRIPT> carefully\n2. Read through all the \"EVALUATION CRITERIAS\" , \"KEY DEFINITIONS\" , and \"FUNDAMENTAL RULES\" to understand what and how to evaluate a <SUMMARY>\n3.Evaluate every single information of the <SUMMARY> based on the \"EVALUATION_CRITERIAS\" , step by step.\n4.Write the evaluation results in the format specified in the \"OUTPUT STRUCTURE\"\n\n##EVALUATION CRITERIAS\n- Factuality: Are all the information, including quantitative and qualitative metrics and insights extracted from the transcript?\n- Metric Accuracy: Are all the quantifiable and qualitative metrics precisely correct from the transcript?\nQuestion accuracy: Are the questions correctly representing what was asked. even if omitting some parts that are not significant for the analysts' sentiment and contextualization?\n- Metric specificity: When a metric is mentioned, is it specifically associated with the metric and/or product/service?\n - Question Completedness : are all questions, including the sub-questions nested in one question, included in the summary?\n- Question grouping: Are related sub-questions of an analyst grouped into one block , and the different ones separated?\nAnswer Completedness: is all \"Key Information\" of an answer captured in the summary. See below what forms a \"Key Information\"\n\n##KEY DEFINITIONS\n###Definition of a KEY INFORMATION that should be included in a summary:\n-Any quantified metrics that impacted a financial result\n-Any significant changes in the company's management, strategy, investment, , roadmap, or production\n-Any reference to investors' questions or financial results and KPIs in the question, even if it was already mentioned by other analysts\n-Any significant changes in customer behavior and/or product/service performance , characteristics, or production\n-Any explicitly stated guidance, outlook, opportunity , and risk\n-Any **explicit** sentiment conveyed in an executive's answer and analyst's question. Not all answers or questions will convey a sentiment explicitly enough to do a sentiment analysis.\nWhen an executive didn't replied directly to the question\n\n\n\n##FUNDAMENTAL RULES\n- Single ground truth is from the transcript provided by the user in the following messages.\n- Do not depend on the information of the summaries nor outside sources. Consider that the transcript is your single source of truth\n- Focus on evaluating the **content** of the summary, ignore the structure of the headings and bullet points.\n\n##Your output should follow the structure specified in the \"OUTPUT STRUCTURE\" below:\n-If the provided summary successfully meets a criteria, return \"True\" for that criteria.\n-If any information doesn't meet a criteria, respond with \"False\" and provide detailed error information.\n\n## Output Structure\nOutput your response as valid JSON following this exact structure:\n```json\n{OUTPUT_STRUCTURE}\n```\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- Output ONLY valid JSON, no additional text\n- For passed criteria, set \"passed\": true and \"errors\": []\n- For failed criteria, set \"passed\": false and include detailed error objects in the \"errors\" array\n- Each error object must have \"error\", \"summary_text\", and \"transcript_text\" fields\n- Ensure all JSON strings are properly escaped",
      "user_prompt": "Based on the contents inside the following tags: <START TRANSCRIPT> {TRANSCRIPT}<END TRANSCRIPT>;  <START SUMMARY>{SUMMARY}<END SUMMARY>; <START STRUCTURE> ```json\n{SUMMARY_STRUCTURE}\n``` <END STRUCTURE>, generate your output strictly following the \"Output Structure\".  If any of the tags has empty content, immediately stop the task and return \"No [<TRANSCRIPT> <SUMMARY> <STRUCTURE>  ] provided\"",
