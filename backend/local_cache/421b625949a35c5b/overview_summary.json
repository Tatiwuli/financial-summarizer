Key KPIs: total RPO $6.64 billion, current RPO $3.45 billion; Unified SASE ARR $1.15 billion (22% growth) and SecOps ARR $463 million (35% growth); FortiSASE ARR grew >100% with customer base +65%. Product revenue was $509 million and service revenue $1.12 billion; product gross margin 67.8% and service gross margin 87.8%. Management highlighted that FortiSASE is additive (not cannibalistic) with >90% of SASE customers coming from the existing firewall base, and that large deals and upgrades are driving share gains (deals >$1M: number +29%, dollar value +51%). They are ~40%–50% through the 2026 firewall refresh cycle, see OT as a >20% growth area, and are investing in owned SASE infrastructure (historic investment ~ $2 billion; Q2 infrastructure spend $168 million) to gain long-term margin and sovereign SASE advantages; executives also noted a services revenue recognition lag (~29–30 months) that partly explains recent services cadence. Cash generation was strong (adjusted free cash flow $428 million in Q2, $1.27 billion YTD) and the company repurchased ~4.6 million shares for $401 million (remaining authorization ~$1.6 billion).", "guidance_outlook": [{"period_label": "Q3", "metric_name": "Billings", "metric_description": "USD 1.76 billion to USD 1.84 billion (midpoint represents 14% growth at company midpoint) "}, {"period_label": "Q3", "metric_name": "Revenue", "metric_description": "USD 1.67 billion to USD 1.73 billion (midpoint represents 13% growth) "}, {"period_label": "Q3", "metric_name": "Non-GAAP gross margin", "metric_description": "80% to 81% "}, {"period_label": "Q3", "metric_name": "Non-GAAP operating margin", "metric_description": "32.5% to 33.5% "}, {"period_label": "Q3", "metric_name": "Infrastructure investments", "metric_description": "USD 110 million to USD 130 million "}, {"period_label": "FY 2025", "metric_name": "Billings", "metric_description": "USD 7.325 billion to USD 7.475 billion (company raised full-year billings midpoint versus prior outlook) "}, {"period_label": "FY 2025", "metric_name": "Revenue", "metric_description": "USD 6.675 billion to USD 6.825 billion (midpoint implies ~13.3% growth) "}, {"period_label": "FY 2025", "metric_name": "Service revenue", "metric_description": "USD 4.55 billion to USD 4.65 billion (midpoint implies ~14% growth) "}, {"period_label": "FY 2025", "metric_name": "Non-GAAP gross margin", "metric_description": "79% to 81% "}, {"period_label": "FY 2025", "metric_name": "Non-GAAP operating margin", "metric_description": "32% to 33.5% "}, {"period_label": "FY 2025", "metric_name": "Infrastructure investments", "metric_description": "USD 380 million to USD 430 million "}, {"period_label": "FY 2025", "metric_name": "Cash taxes", "metric_description": "USD 400 million to USD 450 million (noted as USD 125 million lower than prior expectation due to new tax law changes) "}, {"period_label": "FY 2025", "metric_name": "Guidance mix change", "metric_description": "Shifted USD 50 million from service to product revenue in full-year outlook (revenue guidance maintained) "}, {"period_label": "Q3 & FY 2025", "metric_name": "Non-GAAP tax rate", "metric_description": "18% "}, {"period_label": "Q3", "metric_name": "Non-GAAP EPS", "metric_description": "USD 0.62 to USD 0.64 (assumes share count 772 million to 776 million) "}, {"period_label": "FY 2025", "metric_name": "Non-GAAP EPS", "metric_description": "USD 2.47 to USD 2.53 (assumes share count 773 million to 777 million) "}]}}
