Partial answer—no explicit mix provided."}]}, {"name": "Shrenik Kothari", "firm": "Baird", "questions": [{"question": "Update on go-to-market for platform/multiproduct adoption, including channel incentive design and what’s working or needs work?", "answer_summary": "CEO said Fortinet is adding direct marketing/sales for large enterprises alongside channel, driving strong big-deal growth (40%–50%) and platform sales (SASE, SD-WAN, SecOps) with AI-enabled SecureOps (FortiAI-Assist, FortiAI-Protect). CFO said channel incentives are aligned to multiproduct adoption, with higher back-end rebates for introducing new products."}]}, {"name": "Eric Heath", "firm": "KeyBanc", "questions": [{"question": "If >$100M refresh occurred over the last 2–3 quarters, does that imply underlying firewall/product demand is flat to negative? Why isn’t it stronger?", "answer_summary": "CEO disagreed with the negative view; refresh is a small share of total business. Raised billings guidance for the rest of the year reflects confidence beyond refresh. Emphasis is on upgrading customers to the new SASE firewall; EOS units from 12–15 years ago are a small portion of today’s base. Answer was partial; no quantified ex-refresh growth provided."}]}, {"name": "Andrew Nowinski", "firm": "Wells Fargo", "questions": [{"question": "Why is services revenue growth decelerating over the past four quarters and going forward?", "answer_summary": "CFO said COVID-era deferred revenue recognition boosted services over the last couple of years; now product and services are aligning more closely with billings growth. Need to accelerate growth to drive both lines. CEO noted the services recognition lag of ~29–30 months tied to prior product surges; improving product trends should feed future services."}, {"question": "Why was Unified SASE flat sequentially in Q2 despite strong momentum? It appears ~$1.15B in both Q1 and Q2—why flat sequentially?", "answer_summary": "CFO said sequential flatness reflects some products within Unified SASE not growing or turning slightly negative, offset by strong SSE growth. CEO added SSE is growing very strongly; SD-WAN penetration is already high, and customers are now moving rapidly from SD-WAN to SASE. CEO asserted Fortinet’s three SASE advantages (single OS, large installed base for easy upgrades, own infrastructure cost advantage) position it to be #1 in SASE in the next few years. COO emphasized 800k customers with a clear path from firewall to SD-WAN to SASE under one OS as a major growth driver."}]}]}}
