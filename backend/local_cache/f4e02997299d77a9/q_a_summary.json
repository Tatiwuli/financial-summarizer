CEO believes there will be more developers and more people across functions creating software in 5 years, more software overall, and more need to manage it, expanding Atlassian’s opportunity. Internally, Atlassian uses Rovo Dev on top of SWE-bench, plus 3–4 code-generation tools at >1,000 users each, boosting speed and output, while continuing to hire engineers. AI is viewed as a huge tailwind. Tools and platforms cited: Jira, Rovo Dev, SWE-bench.

How should we think about the trajectory for free cash flow in 2026?", "answer_summary": "CFO said Q4 free cash flow was $360 million, down 13% year-over-year, primarily due to strong prior-year collections tied to server/support dynamics; results were in line with expectations. Near-term temporal headwinds include shifting multiyear agreements from upfront to annual billing and more backloaded sales as enterprise cloud grows; accounting for this, cash flow reflected strong quarterly performance. Longer term, free cash flow will correlate with non-GAAP operating income trends; short-term differences are timing-related (e.g., Q1 bonus payout). Over time, expect about a 500 basis point difference between non-GAAP operating margin and free cash flow margin, with plus/minus variation; this remains the expectation for FY ’26 and beyond. Forward-looking: FCF margin ~500 bps below non-GAAP op margin over time."}]}, {"name": "Kash Rangan", "firm": "Goldman Sachs", "questions": [{"question": "To maintain your longer-term growth guidance, fiscal ’27 seems to imply acceleration from fiscal ’26. What potential inflection points and levers (go-to-market tweaks, enterprise flex, server/Data Center-to-Cloud transition) can drive that acceleration?", "answer_summary": "CFO said FY ’26 guidance approach is unchanged from FY ’25: conservative and risk-adjusted for macro uncertainty and potential disruption from evolving the enterprise go-to-market motion. No change to outlook to deliver 20% compounded annual growth from FY ’24 through FY ’27; 20% growth in FY ’25 lays a strong foundation. Growth levers: paid seat expansion, cross-sell, upsell, pricing, new customer growth; AI expands opportunity given cloud platform position and Teamwork Graph plus R&D investment. CEO reiterated confidence in long-term revenue and margin targets; highlighted strong Teamwork Collection momentum in first 3 months. Cited customer wins: a global automotive manufacturer (high tens of thousands of users) adopting Teamwork Collection and Strategy Collection, with AI integration a core reason; a leading chip company migrating tens of thousands of users from Data Center to Cloud, consolidating onto Atlassian, citing AI, third-party integrations, Rovo search, and Rovo chat.

Compare how FY ’25 closed relative to the execution risk embedded in guidance. RPO and bookings look supportive—how did the year close vs. forecast and initial FY ’26 guide?", "answer_summary": "CFO said execution by sales and partners drove very strong bookings and billings. RPO reached $3.3 billion, up 38% year-over-year; roughly 74% to be recognized in the next 12 months, up 29% year-over-year; the remaining portion increased 71% driven by large cloud multiyear agreements—signaling customer commitment and confidence. Record number of $1 million+ deals; Data Center-to-Cloud migrations up 60% year-over-year; strong Teamwork Collection momentum. Revenue exceeded expectations: Cloud and marketplace outperformed, Data Center in line. Assumed negative impact on paid seat expansion and migrations in guidance did not fully materialize; macro and business trends remained relatively stable. Q4 Cloud outperformance drivers: paid seat expansion, cross-sell, migrations; other cloud drivers in line. Data Center growth driven by pricing, partially offset by cloud migrations; benefited from several large renewals. Marketplace outperformance driven by third-party app sales from Data Center. Steady performance across products, segments, regions.

AI is a huge tailwind; Atlassian continues to innovate with AI embedded in the core cloud platform and Teamwork Graph. Metrics cited: net expansion rate of 120%; AI users reached 2.3 million (up from 1.5 million last quarter); token usage up 5x quarter-on-quarter. Examples: Rovo Dev CLI launched; MCP servers in beta; working with Anthropic; continuing to work with OpenAI on GPT-5. Confluence impact: users who use editor AI create 15% more pages and make 33% more edits than before. Forward-looking: more AI capabilities shipping; continued platform-led differentiation."}, {"question": "Help us understand the mid-single-digit migration contribution in Cloud guidance. How did FY ’25 migration contribution pan out versus last year’s expectations, and why the conservatism for FY ’26 mid-single-digit contribution?", "answer_summary": "CFO said FY ’25 migrations contributed in the mid- to high single-digit range to Cloud revenue growth, helped by prior-year server/support-related migrations. Strong Q4 and FY ’25 on migrations driven by investments in customer success and forward-deployed engineering (e.g., Fast shift) and by R&D adding automation, analytics, and AI to the Cloud platform and apps. For FY ’26, guidance assumes a sequentially lower mid-single-digit contribution due to macro and enterprise go-to-market evolution risks and the complexity of remaining Data Center migrations (largest, most complex customers; hybrid approaches; quarter-to-quarter variability). Longer term, expect migrations to contribute mid- to high single digits to Cloud revenue growth over the next 2 to 3 years. Forward-looking: migration contribution mid- to high single digits over 2–3 years; FY ’26 mid-single-digit assumption is conservative."}]}, {"name": "Arjun Bhatia", "firm": "William Blair", "questions": [{"question": "Enterprise was very strong with $1 million+ ACV deals.

Anything unique about the September quarter driving caution?", "answer_summary": "CFO said Q1 Data Center guidance is approximately 8%, a step down from Q4. Drivers: Q4 benefited from several large renewals and has a much bigger expiration base than Q1; Q1 is seasonally weaker with less opportunity for expansion and price increases. Q4 growth was driven primarily by pricing and partially offset by Cloud migrations. Additional Q1 headwinds: shift to 1-year deal terms from a programmatic change a year ago; beginning to lap prior server/support migration benefits. Primary factor is smaller expiration base in Q1."}]}, {"name": "Gregg Moskowitz", "firm": "Mizuho", "questions": [{"question": "It’s easier said than done to drive more wall-to-wall deployments.

Business user segment growth has accelerated and is a major opportunity. Drivers: Teamwork Collection broadens offering by separating software from broad collaboration pieces; ongoing investments in design, speed, performance, and Jira usability for business teams; Loom adoption in sales and outbound communication expands Atlassian footprint; Trello remains strong with broad users; Rovo (search/chat/agents) with connectors enabling business teams to run workflows across Atlassian and third-party tools.

Will it show up first in consumption/usage or more effective cross-sell?", "answer_summary": "CFO said strategy prioritizes deployment, usage, and engagement for Rovo; monetization is secondary and longer-term. FY ’26 plan includes some consumption-based Rovo revenue, but guidance assumes very nominal amounts due to limits set to incent adoption. Expect broader benefits over time: seat expansion, upgrades to higher editions, and migrations. Seeing strong premium and enterprise edition uptake, partly due to AI/Rovo value. CEO added: Teamwork Collection uplift across seats is partially AI-driven; there is a SKU for non-Atlassian users to access Rovo search/chat as a stepping stone, though preference is to move them into Teamwork Collection. Increasing use of consumption pricing in Forge, Bitbucket pipelines, JSM virtual service agents and assets, and AI credits; Teamwork Collection includes a larger set of AI credits to drive usage while managing margin. Metrics: token usage up 5x quarter-on-quarter; AI tools growth rate ~50%-ish; premium and enterprise editions growth rate about 40% year-over-year. Rovo Dev and Rovo Dev CLI are unmonetized to drive usage first. Forward-looking: monetization later via consumption and cross-sell/upsell as usage scales.

Operating margin guidance is 24%, slightly lower than FY ’25, reflecting conservative, risk-adjusted revenue guidance; relatively stable gross margins as cloud infrastructure/support optimization offsets greater cloud mix and rising AI usage costs; and ongoing investments. Framework: manage costs carefully, invest in highest-return opportunities, and meet profitability commitments; sometimes invest upside, other times allow revenue/gross margin outperformance to drop to bottom line.
