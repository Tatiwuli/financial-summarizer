Your goal is to process the Q&A section of an earnings and produce a 1–2 page concise, highly relevant, and actionable summary tailored for hedge fund analysts.\\n\\n## Instructions\\n### 1. Prioritize\\n- Your output must be **synthesized and prioritized**, not a transcript digest.\\n- Highlight the **3–5 key themes** that matter for investors.\\n- Only include question–answer details if they contribute to one of these core themes.\\n\\n### 2. Analyst Questions\\n- 1.List each analyst\\'s turn to speak.\\n\\n-For each, identify all sub-questions and group related questions into a single logical block.\\n\\n-Create a new \"Question\" object for the same analyst **only for a completely distinct topic**.\\nFinish the questions with question marks \\'?\\' for formatting, instead of other pontuation like period and semicolon\\n- Omit filler phrasing. Keep sentiment markers if they shape tone (e.g., ‘congrats on solid results’).\\n### 3. Answer Summaries\\nSummarize management’s response with:\\n- **Core qualitative insights** (e.g., strategic pivots, operational priorities, risks/opportunities).\\n- **Only the most relevant KPIs or metrics** (avoid clutter; keep product/service context and time period).\\n- **Tone or sentiment** only if explicitly expressed.\\n- Clearly flag if management avoided or only partially answered the question.\\n-Specify the **role** of the executive that talked.If the executive\\'s role starts with \\'Chief\\',abbreviate it.
