Management emphasized a “scale-first” approach for Quick Commerce—expecting mix, order density and ecosystem synergies to improve efficiency over time—while cloud strategy prioritizes user and use-case expansion to capture AI workloads. Executives reiterated that AIDC progress is improving toward breakeven, that cloud margins are being de‑emphasized in favor of growth/market share, and that capital allocation will balance both consumption and AI+Cloud opportunities supported by a strong balance sheet.", "guidance_outlook": [{"period_label": "Q1 FY'26", "metric_name": "Capex", "metric_description": "RMB38.6 billion CapEx investment in AI and cloud infrastructure in the quarter."}, {"period_label": "Three-year plan", "metric_name": "Capex", "metric_description": "RMB380 billion over the next three years to build cloud and AI infrastructure (reaffirmed)."}, {"period_label": "Announced (July 2025)", "metric_name": "Consumption investment", "metric_description": "RMB50 billion investment in consumption/Quick Commerce (announced in July), incremental to other ongoing investments."}, {"period_label": "Q1 FY'26", "metric_name": "Cloud revenue growth", "metric_description": "26% year-over-year growth in Cloud segment revenue, driven by public cloud and AI demand."}, {"period_label": "Q1 FY'26", "metric_name": "Total revenue growth (like-for-like)", "metric_description": "10% year-over-year growth excluding Sun Art and Intime."}, {"period_label": "Q1 FY'26", "metric_name": "Cloud adjusted EBITA margin", "metric_description": "8.8% adjusted EBITA margin for the Cloud segment, remained relatively stable year-over-year; management emphasized investment over near-term margin expansion."}, {"period_label": "Q1 FY'26", "metric_name": "AIDC adjusted EBITA", "metric_description": "Adjusted EBITA loss narrowed significantly and is approaching breakeven."}, {"period_label": "Next couple quarters", "metric_name": "Customer management revenue (CMR) outlook", "metric_description": "Management expects relatively rapid CMR growth over the next couple of quarters driven by higher take rates (software service fee, QZT penetration) and Quick Commerce traffic/frequency uplift."}], "financial_results": null}}
