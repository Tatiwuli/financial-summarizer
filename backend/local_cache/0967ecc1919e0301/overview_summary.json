Management highlighted Quick Commerce traction—monthly active consumers approaching 300 million in August, peak daily orders of 120 million and strong rider growth—which is already driving higher Taobao engagement, frequency, advertising revenue and Customer Management Revenue (CMR); they view Quick Commerce as an ecosystem growth engine rather than a standalone profit center and expect UE losses to shrink as mix, AOV and logistics efficiencies improve. On Cloud/AI, robust AI-driven demand (Cloud revenue up 26% YoY; AI-related revenue >20% of external customer revenue) and upgraded Qwen3 models/AgentBay are expanding training/inference workloads and enterprise agent use cases, supporting continued cloud adoption while the Cloud adjusted EBITA margin remained stable at 8.8%. Management reiterated large-scale investment commitments (RMB380 billion for Cloud & AI, plus an announced RMB50 billion for consumption), noted this quarter’s CapEx intensity (RMB38.6 billion) and acknowledged near-term pressure on consolidated adjusted EBITA (down 14% YoY, China E-commerce adjusted EBITA down 21%) driven by Quick Commerce investment, while saying AIDC losses have narrowed and are approaching breakeven and that CMR and Cloud revenue are expected to show relatively rapid growth in the coming quarters.", "guidance_outlook": [{"period_label": "Next 3 years", "metric_name": "CapEx (Cloud & AI)", "metric_description": "RMB380 billion committed investment over the next three years to build cloud and AI infrastructure."}, {"period_label": "Announced (July)", "metric_name": "Consumption Investment", "metric_description": "RMB50 billion planned investment in consumption (announced in July)."}, {"period_label": "This quarter", "metric_name": "CapEx", "metric_description": "RMB38.6 billion CapEx investment in AI and cloud infrastructure in this quarter."}, {"period_label": "Near term (next couple of quarters)", "metric_name": "CMR Growth", "metric_description": "Relatively rapid Customer Management Revenue growth expected driven by the 0.6% software service fee, deeper QZT penetration and Quick Commerce-driven user growth and frequency."}, {"period_label": "This quarter", "metric_name": "Cloud Revenue Growth", "metric_description": "Cloud revenue grew 26% year-over-year this quarter; management expects continued AI-driven cloud growth in coming quarters."}, {"period_label": "This quarter", "metric_name": "Cloud Adjusted EBITA Margin", "metric_description": "8.8% adjusted EBITA margin for Cloud, remained relatively stable year-over-year."}, {"period_label": "Near term", "metric_name": "AIDC Adjusted EBITA", "metric_description": "AIDC adjusted EBITA loss narrowed significantly and is approaching breakeven."}], "financial_results": null}}
