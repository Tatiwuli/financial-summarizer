Your goal is to produce a structured summary that captures what matters most to investors: analysts\\' main questions and executives\\' answers on company performance, strategy, outlook, and risks.\\n\\n## Instructions\\n### 1. Identify and Process All Q&A Pairs\\n- For each analyst–executive exchange, **concisely summarize the question** (include implicit asks, e.g., requests for updates or views).\\n- **Omit filler phrases** (e.g., \\'My question is for...\\'), but retain framing or sentiment if relevant (e.g., \\'Congrats on strong results\\').\\n- If an analyst cites **specific metrics, results, or KPIs**, include them exactly.\\n- For the **executive\\'s answer**, capture in BULLET POINTS format:\\n  - Key **metrics** with product/segment, time period, and driver.\\n  - The **executive\\'s stated perspective, tone, or strategy**.\\n\\n**BULLET POINTS FORMATTING RULES:**\\n- Structure the answer_summary as an array of strings\\n- Each string in the array should be a single, concise bullet point\\n- Do NOT include bullet point symbols (\"•\" or \"-\") in the strings\\n- Each array element should be a complete, standalone sentence\\n- Keep the same content and detail level as prose format\\n- Maintain all metrics, context, and insights\\n\\n### 2. Group by Topic When Logical\\n- If multiple questions clearly follow up on the **same theme**, group them under one topic.\\n- If unrelated, assign each its own topic.\\n- Topics should be short, clear, and investor-relevant (e.g., \\'Macro housing trends\\', \\'AI deployment\\', \\'Capital allocation\\').\\n -Specify the abbreviation of the **role** of the executive that talked ( e.g. CFO, instead of Chief Financial Officer or the executive\\'s name). \\n\\n### 3. Rules of Summarization\\n- **Single source only**: Use only the transcript between <START TRANSCRIPT> and <END TRANSCRIPT>. If empty, return \"No transcript provided.\"\\n- **Full coverage**: Every Q&A segment must appear; no material omissions.\\n- **No fabrication**: Do not infer beyond the transcript.\\n- **Conciseness**: Avoid transcript-like detail. Prioritize relevance to investors and long-term strategy.\\n- **Forward-looking clarity**: Always include  guidance, risks, or opportunities if mentioned explicitly.\\n\\n## Output Structure\\nReturn output as valid JSON in this exact format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\"title\": \"[Company name] [Quarter, date if available]\", \"topics\": [{\"topic\": \"[Short topic name]\", \"question_answers\": [{\"name\": \"[Analyst Name]\", \"firm\": \"[Firm]\", \"questions\": [{\"question\": \"[ Question text, preserving relevant sentiment and context and removing filler words]\", \"answers\": [{\"executive\": \"[Abbreviation of the executive\\'s role who answered the question]\", \"answer_summary\": [\"[First bullet point with key metric or insight]\", \"[Second bullet point with additional context]\", \"[Third bullet point with forward-looking statement]\", \"[Continue with more bullet points as needed]\"]}]}]}]}]}\\n```\\n\\nIMPORTANT:\\n- Output ONLY valid JSON, no additional text or markdown.\\n- Summaries should read like an equity analyst\\'s note: concise, structured, investor-focused.\\n- The answer_summary field should contain an array of strings as described above', metadata={}, model='gpt-5-2025-08-07', object='response', output=[ResponseReasoningItem(id='rs_68b65b2cb1b481a2915189f7a90ae94c09404ec75435a079', summary=[], type='reasoning', content=None, encrypted_content=None, status=None), ParsedResponseOutputMessage[ConferenceSummarizeOutputFormatBullet](id='msg_68b65b2d0a0881a2b699f65268bf38ba09404ec75435a079', content=[ParsedResponseOutputText[ConferenceSummarizeOutputFormatBullet](annotations=[], text='{\"title\":\"Qualcomm Q&A with Deutsche Bank – Aug 28, 2025\",\"topics\":[{\"topic\":\"Diversification strategy and operating model\",\"question_answers\":[{\"name\":\"Ross Clark Seymore\",\"firm\":\"Deutsche Bank\",\"questions\":[{\"question\":\"At a high level, how are you tasked with driving diversification across non-handset markets and allocating resources?\",\"answers\":[{\"executive\":\"SVP/GM Auto & Cloud\",\"answer_summary\":[\"Qualcomm builds independent, market-proximate businesses outside mobile, starting with automotive a decade ago to meet quality, safety, long life-cycle, and supply resilience needs\",\"Automotive is managed independently from mobile with a longer investment horizon and dedicated resources\",\"The automotive playbook informed entry into slower-cadence markets like industrial, leveraging M&A and strategic partnerships where needed\"]}],\"answer_summary\":null}]}]},{\"topic\":\"Auto revenues, growth drivers and mix shift to compute/ADAS\",\"question_answers\":[{\"name\":\"Ross Clark Seymore\",\"firm\":\"Deutsche Bank\",\"questions\":[{\"question\":\"You are on track for nearly $4B auto revenue this calendar year with ~40% 5-year CAGR;
