Automotive was set up and is now run largely independent from mobile, reflecting long \ncycles, safety/quality needs, and supply-chain resilience. Lessons from auto inform moves into slower-\ncadence industrial markets; investments include M&A and strategic partnerships guided by this strategy.\nAutomotive revenue drivers, mix shift, and outlook to $9B\nRoss Clark Seymore - Deutsche Bank\nQ: What has driven auto growth to nearly $4B CY25 (≈40% 5-yr CAGR), and how insulated are you from \nauto cyclicality?\nA: SVP said OEMs value Qualcomm’s predictability, software investment, breadth in semis, and 5-year \nroad-map visibility. Revenues arrived a year ahead due to winning programs at the right time across a \nbroad global OEM base, which diversifies across drivetrains and regions, reducing cyclicality exposure.\nQ: How does mix evolve from ~$4B today to the ~$9B target by fiscal ’31; role of the $45B pipeline and \ntransition from connectivity to ADAS/compute?\nA: SVP said connectivity (modem, RF, Wi‑Fi, BT, GPS, PLC) is the most predictable base. Growth above that \nis tied to adoption of central compute and consolidation of ECUs. Gen3 cockpit is deploying broadly for \n7–8 years at some OEMs, while Gen5 (sampled early ’25) targets SOP in 1Q26 with ~15x performance vs \nGen3. ADAS designs began scaling mid‑’24 with Gen4.5; 20 OEMs announced and growing. Aligning \ncockpit and ADAS architectures cuts OEM software cost, driving compute concentration over next 5 \nyears. The $45B pipeline underpins the path to $9B.\nQ: Is most of today’s $4B connectivity/cockpit, with ADAS a much larger mix by ~$9B?\nA: SVP said yes; architectures are blending via the Flex platform, and the compute portfolio will be a much \nlarger portion over the next 5 years.\nQ: Key external milestones to monitor to get from $4B to $9B?\nA: SVP said execution against the disclosed design pipeline (program ramp health) and continued win \nrate/pipeline replenishment. Macro risks include tariffs, OEM sales trends, China competition (esp. in \nEurope/ROW). However, auto silicon SAM is expanding as content per vehicle rises; most required \nproducts are already designed/in design based on customer road maps.\nADAS differentiation, stack strategy, and Flex architecture\nRoss Clark Seymore - Deutsche Bank\nQ: Primary ADAS differentiators and scalability across tiers and software?\nA: SVP said Qualcomm optimizes robust, known ADAS stacks for silicon/power/performance, extracting \nstrong perf/area within thermal envelopes. Portfolio tiers (entry, mid, premium) use a common software \nplatform from premium SoC to entry, minimizing OEM switching costs across tiers and generations.\nQ: Role and impact of Arriver acquisition and BMW partnership on software stack?\nA: SVP said Qualcomm moved into ADAS stacks during COVID via Arriver to gain deployed experience; \nBMW engagement shaped next-gen requirements. Qualcomm built computer vision stack in-house—\ncommercial by year-end across 60 countries (100 next year). In 2022 they had no stack; next month a \nglobal stack launches. With BMW, they co-developed drive policy. Arriver brought expertise/IP and \ninternalized know-how to run a stack business.\nQ: Competitive positioning vs Mobileye/NVIDIA; where do you stand on active safety vs higher-level \nfeatures?\nA: SVP said active safety stack compliance is the baseline; Mobileye is the gold standard. Qualcomm \naims to meet and ultimately exceed requirements. Beyond that, performance depends on OEM sensor \nsets and features; Qualcomm is showcasing stack performance for customers and porting to other \nOEMs.\nQ: Explain Snapdragon Ride Flex and why it’s unique; ability to blend infotainment and safety domains?\nA: SVP said Gen4.5 enabled running infotainment and driver-assistance stacks without strict domain \nseparation. Gen5 is 3–5x more powerful than 4.5, allowing concurrent stacks with headroom. OEMs \nowning stacks can run them as applications, enabling mid-tier cost optimization by consolidating from \ntwo ECUs to one ECU/SoC. First Flex launch is with Leapmotor (China) in mid-’26.\nQ: Silicon competitive landscape and tiering strategy (L1 up vs L4/5 down)?\nA: SVP said 5 years ago Qualcomm bet on L2+ and below, avoiding L5/robotaxis. A common safety-\ncapable platform spans cockpit and ADAS, scaling from entry to super-premium; only very basic \ncommodity entry silicon is outside scope. Tens of millions of safety-grade chips ship annually (hundreds \nof millions deployed), multi-sourced and software-proven—raising execution barriers for new entrants.\nQ: Has the focus shifted beyond L2+ toward L3?\nA: SVP said they’re transitioning to an end-to-end, data-driven AI stack that can advance to L3. Majority of \nmarket likely remains L2+ due to liability, cost, and adoption dynamics. Emphasis is on safety and \nredundant architectures for any L3 deployments, guided by learnings with BMW.\nQ: How to reconcile multiple vendors claiming design wins at the same OEMs?\nA: SVP said it varies by OEM, region, and domain. Telemetics/infotainment show less multi-sourcing. In \nADAS, overlapping generations are common due to long cycles and delays; EV architectures drive specific \nsupplier sets. Large OEMs often have multiple SoC suppliers across programs; smaller OEMs tend to pick \none. In China’s fast cycle, overlapping programs are frequent.\nQ: Content-per-vehicle and ASPs as customers move from connectivity to cockpit to ADAS; profitability \nscaling?\nA: SVP said connectivity ASPs are predictable and “mostly double digits.” Infotainment/ADAS carry \nsignificant premium from integration and BOM reduction; specifics not disclosed and vary by tier. Content \nper vehicle rises toward ADAS, and profitability scales with tier/content (exact margins not disclosed).\nIndustrial/embedded IoT strategy, scale-up and $4B FY29 target\nRoss Clark Seymore - Deutsche Bank\nQ: Size and scope of industrial business within IoT, and strategic approach vs auto?\nA: SVP said industrial is “a bit north” of ~$1B within ~$6–6.5B IoT. Strategy focuses on packaging \nproducts per industry, simplifying use, and strengthening channels. Five product segments: industrial \nconnectivity; cameras (doubling down with AI); consumer & commercial processors (retail/enterprise/\nhome/appliances); industrial processors (leveraging auto IP); and robotics & drones. Revamped GTM by \nvertical, building solutions (especially for cameras) and pivoting to developer-focused engagement to \nbroaden accessibility.\nQ: Core differentiation entering industrial and examples of execution?\nA: SVP said Qualcomm’s scale and ability to meet customers at the solution level across a massive \nportfolio (from Bluetooth shelf labels to industrial PCs/robots/drones) is unique. Example: Aramco \npartnership with ~2 dozen projects, supported by teams in Riyadh and Iran, showcases end-to-end \nengagement. Confident in growth trajectory for industrial/embedded IoT.\nQ: GTM motion: direct vs distribution?\nA: SVP said it’s a mix. Complex products are direct-touch; developer-focused initiatives aim to simplify \nofferings to make more SKUs distribution-friendly. Some products already sell via distribution.\nQ: Path to ~tripling/quadrupling industrial revenue to ~$4B by fiscal ’29; what’s required?\nA: SVP said two customer profiles drive growth: existing customers expanding into broader Qualcomm \nportfolios (cameras, industrial and consumer processors), and less-familiar customers who need easier, \nmore accessible products. The market is large; Qualcomm will add many portfolio products while building \nonly 1–2 net-new products—leveraging internal IP reuse to minimize incremental R&D.
