Microsoft’s response emphasizes a GenAI-first, platform-consolidation strategy: Security Copilot (>1,000 customers) delivers ~30% reduction in MTTR, Sentinel is a $1B business, and Microsoft Security revenue was >$20B two years ago; the company processes 84 trillion signals/day (vs 8 trillion five years ago) across 50+ integrated security categories and claims leadership in 19 categories. Key initiatives include Secure Future Initiative (34,000 engineers, 11 months, CEO/Board governance), Entra/identity as the architectural center (including Entra Agent ID for agentic AI), expansion of Security Copilot agents (11 launched; 6 Microsoft, 5 partners), and technical innovations in SOC (SIEM+XDR integration, hot/cold data lake to reduce SIEM costs). These themes underpin Microsoft’s argument that security is a top 2–3, defensible customer spend that drives platform adoption and shareholder value.
