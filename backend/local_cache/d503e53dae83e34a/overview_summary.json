Sarandos", "role": "Co-CEO"}], "overview": "Netflix reported strengthening underlying business momentum alongside FX benefits: management cited a late-Q2 pickup in member growth and faster-than-expected ad-sales momentum as the primary operational drivers behind the updated outlook. Executives emphasized the completed global rollout of the Netflix Ad Suite and a steady feature roadmap (including interactivity in 2H'25) as key to ad growth, while live-event capabilities and strategic partnerships (e.g., TF1 in France, CBS-produced NFL Christmas Day games) are being scaled via a mix of in-house and partner production. The new TV UI is performing better than tests and should improve discovery metrics; generative-AI (Eye Line) is already accelerating VFX/production workflows and will be applied to personalization and ad creative; gaming monetization remains nascent. Management reiterated a disciplined capital-allocation stance (focus on organic investment and share repurchases over large legacy-media M&A) and said content and marketing will ramp in H2 to support a heavy slate and live events.
