Netflix has maintained share amid more TV-based streaming services, free and paid, the impact of paid sharing, and a 2025 slate more back-half weighted than typical. Long term, share grows as the remaining ~50% of TV viewing migrates from linear to streaming by continuously improving the service. Since 2020, content amortization has grown more than 50%, from under $11 billion to more than $16 billion expected in 2025, alongside increased revenue, profit, and profit margin.

Rationale: prior UI was designed for the Netflix of 10 years ago; the business now spans broader TV/film from around the world, games, and live events, requiring a different discovery experience (e.g., giving reasons to tune in at a specific time like 7:00 p.m. Friday). New UI leverages newer technologies like real-time recommendations that adapt to user context (e.g., Tuesday night vs. Sunday afternoon). Forward-looking: confident the new UX is a stronger platform to support business needs and continuous improvement over coming years.\"},{\"question\":\"YouTube is the only streamer that exceeds Netflix in terms of U.S. share of TV time. Do you see an opportunity to bring notable YouTube creators and their content exclusively to Netflix? How big could this opportunity be?\",\"answer_summary\":\"Co-CEO said Netflix wants to work with the best creatives globally, including social-only creators. Agrees that not everything on YouTube fits Netflix, but some creators are a great fit (e.g., Ms. Rachel had 53 million views in 1H’25 on Netflix per the engagement report). Netflix is excited about creators like the Sidemen and Pop the Balloon, and video podcasters that could fit. Co-CEO added competitive context: Netflix competes with linear, streamers, games, social media; free services are strong competition. Netflix will compete to win the most profitable moments given its strong profit model. Noted about 80% of total TV view share is not won by Netflix or YouTube, representing a huge opportunity; the vast majority of focus is on that 80%.\"}]},{\"name\":\"Alan Gould\",\"firm\":\"Loop Capital\",\"questions\":[{\"question\":\"Provide more information on the TF1 partnership.

Should we anticipate similar partnerships in other countries?\",\"answer_summary\":\"Co-CEO said rationale is to expand the entertainment offering with more variety and quality, specifically highly relevant local-for-local content in France where demand is strong; partnership accelerates meeting that need. Timing is driven by investments in enabling capabilities (live, ads, new UI) required or highly leveraged by this deal. TF1 was chosen as the leading local programmer in a big territory, with strong mutual alignment and familiarity. Both parties see it as a learning opportunity to scale TF1 local content to more customers in France; consumer feedback will inform future plans.

Focus on ownable big breakthrough events that audiences love and must make economic sense; deals must reflect Netflix’s value-add. Live is a relatively small part of total content spend and of ~200 billion view hours, but not all hours are equal; live has outsized positive impacts on conversation, acquisition, and likely retention. Excited about Canelo vs. Crawford in September, the SAG Awards, weekly WWE matches, and the NFL Christmas Day double header (Dallas vs. Washington; Detroit vs. Minnesota).

Principles: provide member choice via different plans, maintain accessible price points to grow globally, and ensure plans deliver reasonable and growing returns to reinvest in entertainment and experience.

Where will Gen AI be most impactful over time, revenue or expense efficiency?\",\"answer_summary\":\"Co-CEO said AI is an opportunity to help creators make films and series better, not just cheaper—AI-powered creator tools used by real people. Current benefits in pre-visualization, shot planning, and VFX. Example: Argentine series leveraged virtual production and AI-powered VFX to depict a building collapsing in Buenos Aires; Netflix’s Eye Line (production innovation group inside Scanline VFX) partnered with creators; the VFX sequence was completed 10x faster than with traditional VFX tools/workflows and at feasible cost, becoming the first Gen AI final footage on screen in a Netflix original series or film. Co-CEO clarified Eye Line is the production innovation group inside Scanline. Co-CEO added member experience will benefit from generative techniques, enhancing personalization and recommendations; piloting a conversational UI where members can use natural language queries (e.g., “a film from the \\'80s that\\'s a dark psychological thriller”) to iterate results, acting as a force multiplier for content ROI. Advertising: generative techniques can lower the hurdle to create brand-forward spots in title universes. Netflix sees advantages via data and scale in leveraging generative AI to deliver benefits to members and creators.

Positive proof points already observed from members playing games, but still small relative to overall business. Netflix will ramp investment (currently quite small vs. overall content) in line with scaling positive effects; remain disciplined not to invest ahead of demonstrated member value. Progress with licensed games (GTA) and internally developed games (Squid Game Unleashed); more coming in both, plus new interactive experiences where Netflix is uniquely positioned. Open to evolving monetization model, but need much more scale before it becomes materially relevant; work comes first. TAM is very large; conviction in strategic opportunity.

Netflix has historically been more builders than buyers and sees big growth runway without changing that playbook. Evaluation framework: scale of opportunity, whether it strengthens the entertainment offering or capabilities, and whether it accelerates strategy—assessed against distraction and opportunity costs. No interest in owning legacy media networks, narrowing the funnel.

TF1 was chosen as the leading local programmer in a big territory, with strong mutual alignment and familiarity.

Operating expenses are essentially unchanged forecast-to-forecast; higher revenues largely flow through to margins.

Some live events already produced in-house; will continue using partners with existing infrastructure to make productions feel bespoke to Netflix. CBS is producing NFL games with Netflix again for Christmas Day (Dallas vs. Washington; Detroit vs. Minnesota).

(Nielsen Gauge) Do you need to spend more on programming or spend differently to materially move your viewing share higher?", "answer_summary": "Co-CEO said goal is to grow share long term. Netflix has maintained share amid more TV-based streaming services, free and paid, the impact of paid sharing, and a 2025 slate more back-half weighted than typical. Long term, share grows as the remaining ~50% of TV viewing migrates from linear to streaming by continuously improving the service. Since 2020, content amortization has grown more than 50%, from under $11 billion to more than $16 billion expected in 2025, alongside increased revenue, profit, and profit margin.

Beyond live, what metrics have improved since the launch of the new UI such as speed of users finding a title and change in failed sessions?", "answer_summary": "Co-CEO said the new TV UI rollout to a first large wave of devices is performing better than prelaunch tests due to improvements made; the rate of improvement increases confidence that metrics (including speed to finding a title and failed sessions) will improve in relatively short order. Rationale: prior UI was designed for the Netflix of 10 years ago; the business now spans broader TV/film from around the world, games, and live events, requiring a different discovery experience (e.g., giving reasons to tune in at a specific time like 7:00 p.m. Friday). New UI leverages newer technologies like real-time recommendations that adapt to user context (e.g., Tuesday night vs. Sunday afternoon). Forward-looking: confident the new UX is a stronger platform to support business needs and continuous improvement over coming years."}, {"question": "YouTube is the only streamer that exceeds Netflix in terms of U.S. share of TV time.

How big could this opportunity be?", "answer_summary": "Co-CEO said Netflix wants to work with the best creatives globally, including social-only creators. Agrees that not everything on YouTube fits Netflix, but some creators are a great fit (e.g., Ms. Rachel had 53 million views in 1H’25 on Netflix per the engagement report). Netflix is excited about creators like the Sidemen and Pop the Balloon, and video podcasters that could fit. Co-CEO added competitive context: Netflix competes with linear, streamers, games, social media; free services are strong competition. Netflix will compete to win the most profitable moments given its strong profit model.
