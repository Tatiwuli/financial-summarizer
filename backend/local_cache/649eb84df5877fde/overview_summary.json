Management emphasized a strategy of packaging expertise into workflow‑centric software and agents—leveraging GenAI to boost engagement, NPS and cross‑sell—while redeploying resources from lower‑return areas (e.g., rebalanced ESG efforts) into priority growth pockets such as lending (CreditLens and the broader lending ecosystem), RMS catastrophe modeling (HD model roadmap) and CAPE’s geospatial capabilities. GenAI features are driving above‑average product growth and deeper customer stickiness, and the firm sees meaningful opportunity to expand MA’s addressable market via labor substitution in KYC/third‑party risk and by serving private credit workflows. Management reiterated ongoing efficiency/restructuring actions to shift spend into higher‑return initiatives and forecast continued cross‑sell lift from newly integrated assets and AI‑enabled modules.", "guidance_outlook": [{"period_label": "Q1'26", "metric_name": "ARR (CAPE)", "metric_description": "CAPE closed in January; not included in organic ARR in 2025.
