Your mission is to read the provided transcript and critically evaluate the content of a SUMMARY based on the EVALUATION CRITERIA  and KEY DEFINITIONS listed below.\\n\\n##Instructions\\nCarefully read through the Q_A_TRANSCRIPT that will be provided. It should be the single source of truth  for any information\\n\\n\\nCarefully read through all EVALUATION CRITERIA, KEY DEFINITIONS, and FUNDAMENTAL RULES to understand what and how to evaluate in a SUMMARY.\\n\\n\\nEvaluate each summarized question and answer in the \"SUMMARY\" against its corresponding question and answer in the \"TRANSCRIPT.\" This evaluation should be in-depth, assessing not only the completeness and accuracy of the information but also analyzing the reasonableness of inferences and paraphrases, going beyond literal terms.\\nWrite the evaluation results in the format specified in the OUTPUT STRUCTURE.\\n\\n\\n##INPUT materials \\nSUMMARY: Must be inside < START SUMMARY>< END SUMMARY> tags \\nQ_A_TRANSCRIPT: Must be inside < START Q_A_TRANSCRIPT>< END Q_A_TRANSCRIPT> tags\\n\\n##Evaluation Criteria\\n- Factuality: Are all pieces of information, including quantitative and qualitative metrics and insights, extracted from the transcript?\\n\\n- Metric Accuracy: Are all quantifiable and qualitative metrics precisely correct according to the transcript?\\n\\n- Question Accuracy: Do the questions correctly represent what was asked, even if minor parts are omitted that are not significant for analyst sentiment or context?\\n\\n- Metric Specificity: When a metric is mentioned, is it specifically tied to the relevant product, service, or category? If not  explicitly stated in the transcript, did the summary  made a reasonable inference on  the metric and its associated impact  and  driver?\\n\\n- Question Completeness: Are all questions, including nested sub-questions, included in the summary?\\n\\n- Question Grouping: Are related sub-questions from one analyst grouped into a single block, with different questions separated?\\n\\n- Answer Completeness: Does the summary capture all Key Information from the answer? (See below for definition.)\\n Note the output structure fo the summary will be provided for your reference.If the structure is not provided, consider the structure of the summary as correct.\\n\\n\\n##Key Definitions\\nDefinition of Key Information that should be included in a summary:\\n- Any quantified metrics that impacted financial results\\n\\n- Any significant changes in company management, strategy, investment, roadmap, or production\\n\\n- Any reference to investor questions or financial results/KPIs, even if already mentioned by other analysts\\n\\n- Any significant changes in customer behavior and/or product/service performance, characteristics, or production\\n\\n- Any explicitly stated guidance, outlook, opportunities, or risks\\n\\n- Any explicit sentiment conveyed in an executive’s answer or analyst’s question (only when clearly stated)\\n\\n- Cases when an executive did not reply directly to a question\\n\\n\\n\\n##Fundamental Rules\\n- **Independent and  evidence-based evaluation**: The source of truth should be from  the q_a transcript, wrapped iinside <Q_A_TRANSCRIPT>  <Q_A_TRANSCRIPT> tags. Do not rely on  evaluating the metrics based on summaries or  external sources. \\n- **Focus Evaluate corresponding parts between  the Q_A_TRANSCRIPT and the SUMMARY**>: Do not evaluate  a part  of  the summary with a different  part of the transcript. Do not mix the content between answers and questions, and questions from different analysts.\\n- Focus on evaluating the content of the summary, not its headings or formatting.\\n -Extract the **exact wordings** and **complete**  the referenced parts for summary_text and   transcript_text fields  in your output.Make sure that the  extracted part is complete  enough to show the reader where you are referring to in the summary or transcript  \\n\\n##Your output should follow the structure specified in the \"OUTPUT STRUCTURE\" below:\\n-If the provided summary successfully meets a criteria, return \"True\" for that criteria.\\n-If any information doesn\\'t meet a criteria, respond with \"False\" and provide detailed error information.\\n\\n## Output Structure\\nOutput your response as valid JSON following this exact structure:\\n```json\\n{\"evaluation_results\": [{\"metric_name\": \"factuality\", \"passed\": true, \"errors\": []}, {\"metric_name\": \"metric_accuracy\", \"passed\": false, \"errors\": [{\"error\": \"Concise description of the inaccurate information and reasoning\", \"summary_text\": \"Exact part of the summary that is wrong\", \"transcript_text\": \"Exact part of the transcript that it should refer to\"}, {\"error\": \"Concise description of the inaccurate information and reasoning\", \"summary_text\": \"Exact part of the summary that is wrong\", \"transcript_text\": \"Exact part of the transcript that it should refer to\"}]}, {\"metric_name\": \"question_accuracy\", \"passed\": true, \"errors\": []}, {\"metric_name\": \"metric_specificity\", \"passed\": true, \"errors\": []}, {\"metric_name\": \"question_completeness\", \"passed\": true, \"errors\": []}, {\"metric_name\": \"question_grouping\", \"passed\": true, \"errors\": []}, {\"metric_name\": \"answer_completeness\", \"passed\": true, \"errors\": []}], \"overall_assessment\": {\"total_criteria\": 7, \"passed_criteria\": 6, \"failed_criteria\": 1, \"overall_passed\": false, \"pass_rate\": 0.857, \"evaluation_timestamp\": \"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z\", \"evaluation_summary\": \"Brief summary of overall evaluation results\"}}\\n```\\n\\nEvery metric in the \\'EVALUATION CRITERIAS\\' should reperesent one dict object in the output.
