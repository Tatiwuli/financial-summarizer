Your goal is to produce a structured summary that captures what matters most to investors: analysts\\' main questions and executives\\' answers on company performance, strategy, outlook, and risks.\\n\\n## Instructions\\n### 1. Identify and Process All Q&A Pairs\\n- For each analyst–executive exchange, **concisely summarize the question** (include implicit asks, e.g., requests for updates or views).\\n- **Omit filler phrases** (e.g., \\'My question is for...\\'), but retain framing or sentiment if relevant (e.g., \\'Congrats on strong results\\').\\n- If an analyst cites **specific metrics, results, or KPIs**, include them exactly.\\n- For the **executive\\'s answer**, capture:\\n  - Key **metrics** with product/segment, time period, and driver.\\n  - The **executive\\'s stated perspective, tone, or strategy**.\\n  - Use only the **role abbreviation** (e.g., \\'CFO said…\\').\\n\\n### 2. Group by Topic When Logical\\n- If multiple questions clearly follow up on the **same theme**, group them under one topic.\\n- If unrelated, assign each its own topic.\\n- Topics should be short, clear, and investor-relevant (e.g., \\'Macro housing trends\\', \\'AI deployment\\', \\'Capital allocation\\').\\n\\n### 3. Rules of Summarization\\n- **Single source only**: Use only the transcript between <START TRANSCRIPT> and <END TRANSCRIPT>. If empty, return \"No transcript provided.\"\\n- **Full coverage**: Every Q&A segment must appear; no material omissions.\\n- **No fabrication**: Do not infer beyond the transcript.\\n- **Conciseness**: Avoid transcript-like detail. Prioritize relevance to investors and long-term strategy.\\n- **Forward-looking clarity**: Always include  guidance, risks, or opportunities if mentioned explicitly.\\n\\n## Output Structure\\nReturn output as valid JSON in this exact format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\"title\": \"[Company name] [Quarter, date if available]\", \"topics\": [{\"topic\": \"[Short topic name]\", \"question_answers\": [{\"name\": \"[Analyst Name]\", \"firm\": \"[Firm]\", \"questions\": [{\"question\": \"[ Question text, preserving relevant sentiment and context and removing filler words]\", \"answer_summary\": \"[Concise, factual summary including exact metrics, context, products, tools, business drivers, forward-looking metrics, and sentiment]\"}]}, {\"name\": \"[Analyst Name]\", \"firm\": \"[Firm]\", \"questions\": [{\"question\": \"[ Question text, preserving relevant sentiment and context and removing filler words]\", \"answer_summary\": \"[Concise, factual summary including exact metrics, context, products, tools, business drivers, forward-looking metrics, and sentiment]\"}]}]}]}\\n```\\n\\nIMPORTANT:\\n- Output ONLY valid JSON, no additional text or markdown.\\n- Summaries should read like an equity analyst\\'s note: concise, structured, investor-focused.', metadata={}, model='gpt-5-2025-08-07', object='response', output=[ResponseReasoningItem(id='rs_68b32befba40819094baa7e029b34eff097c449cf2979c1c', summary=[], type='reasoning', content=None, encrypted_content=None, status=None), ParsedResponseOutputMessage[ConferenceSummarizeOutputFormat](id='msg_68b32beffbdc819091e582e31b643c52097c449cf2979c1c', content=[ParsedResponseOutputText[ConferenceSummarizeOutputFormat](annotations=[], text='{\"title\":\"Moody\\'s Corporation Oppenheimer 28th Annual TMT Conference Q&A (Aug 11, 2025)\",\"topics\":[{\"topic\":\"MA software strategy and AI adoption\",\"question_answers\":[{\"name\":\"Owen Lau\",\"firm\":\"Oppenheimer & Co.\",\"questions\":[{\"question\":\"How do you view the MA software business today amid AI adoption, and where do you want it in 5 years?\",\"answer_summary\":\"President MA said software is a chassis to deliver Moody’s data, analytics, and insights across lending, KYC, and underwriting workflows.
