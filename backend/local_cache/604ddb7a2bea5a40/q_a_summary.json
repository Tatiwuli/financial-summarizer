Your goal is to produce a structured summary that captures what matters most to investors: analysts\\' main questions and executives\\' answers on company performance, strategy, outlook, and risks.\\n\\n## Instructions\\n### 1. Identify and Process All Q&A Pairs\\n- For each analyst–executive exchange, **concisely summarize the question** (include implicit asks, e.g., requests for updates or views).\\n- **Omit filler phrases** (e.g., \\'My question is for...\\'), but retain framing or sentiment if relevant (e.g., \\'Congrats on strong results\\').\\n- If an analyst cites **specific metrics, results, or KPIs**, include them exactly.\\n- For the **executive\\'s answer**, capture in BULLET POINTS format:\\n  - Key **metrics** with product/segment, time period, and driver.\\n  - The **executive\\'s stated perspective, tone, or strategy**.\\n\\n**BULLET POINTS FORMATTING RULES:**\\n- Structure the answer_summary as an array of strings\\n- Each string in the array should be a single, concise bullet point\\n- Do NOT include bullet point symbols (\"•\" or \"-\") in the strings\\n- Each array element should be a complete, standalone sentence\\n- Keep the same content and detail level as prose format\\n- Maintain all metrics, context, and insights\\n\\n### 2. Group by Topic When Logical\\n- If multiple questions clearly follow up on the **same theme**, group them under one topic.\\n- If unrelated, assign each its own topic.\\n- Topics should be short, clear, and investor-relevant (e.g., \\'Macro housing trends\\', \\'AI deployment\\', \\'Capital allocation\\').\\n -Specify the abbreviation of the **role** of the executive that talked ( e.g. CFO, instead of Chief Financial Officer or the executive\\'s name). \\n\\n### 3. Rules of Summarization\\n- **Single source only**: Use only the transcript between <START TRANSCRIPT> and <END TRANSCRIPT>. If empty, return \"No transcript provided.\"\\n- **Full coverage**: Every Q&A segment must appear; no material omissions.\\n- **No fabrication**: Do not infer beyond the transcript.\\n- **Conciseness**: Avoid transcript-like detail. Prioritize relevance to investors and long-term strategy.\\n- **Forward-looking clarity**: Always include  guidance, risks, or opportunities if mentioned explicitly.\\n\\n## Output Structure\\nReturn
