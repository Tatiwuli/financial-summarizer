Microsoft cited massive telemetry scale (84 trillion signals/day vs 8 trillion five years ago), an integrated portfolio across 50+ categories, Security Copilot adoption (1,000+ customers with ~30% reduction in mean time to response), Sentinel disclosed as a $1 billion business, and Security revenue having exceeded $20 billion two years ago; Defender secures 2 million apps and Purview is central to AI data security (75% security attached to Copilot). The Secure Future Initiative (equivalent of 34,000 engineers for 11 months) and Zero Trust principles are being operationalized company-wide, Entra is being extended for agent identities as agentic AI grows, and Microsoft is pushing partner-built Security Copilot agents and SIEM/XDR convergence (new hot/cold data lake to cut SIEM costs).
