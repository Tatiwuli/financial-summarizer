And thank you, everyone, for joining our 2025 half year result conference call.\nIn Q1, the real estate market continued the recovery momentum we saw at the end of last year.\nHowever, as we entered Q2 as the momentum softened and the slowdown was largely due to\ninternational trade friction and the feeding impact of the early policy measures. Because of the\nhigh base created by intensive earning policy in the middle of last year, the real estate market\nrecorded as a year-over-year decline in Q2.\nTurning to our business performance, our platform, patent and store network continued to scale\nalong with refined operations and ecosystem improvement. Our existing home and new home\nbusiness significantly outperformed the market in the first half of 2025. The proportion of the\nnumber of housing transactions from existing home sales reached a record high. At the same\ntime, our home renovation and furniture business and the home rental service business both\nachieved high-quality growth. Revenue from non-housing transaction services accounted for 41%\nof total revenue in Q2 highlighting our diversified growth drivers.\nRegarding our overall financial performance in Q2, our total GTV was RMB878.7 billion,\nrepresenting a year-over-year increase of 4.7%. The revenue reached RMB26 billion, up 11.3%\nyear-over-year. Gross margin declined by 6 percentage points year-over-year to 21.9%. GAAP net\nincome was RMB1.31 billion, falling 31.2% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net revenue reached RMB1.82\nbillion, down 32.4% year-over-year.\nNext, I'd like to elaborate on the operational updates and the financial performance of our\nbusiness segment. Looking at our housing transaction services, the momentum from our\nproactive growth efforts has been clearly evident. In the first half of the year, the number of\nexisting home sales on our platform rose by 26%, outpacing the market growth rate of 19%\nestimated by Beike Research Institute, both year-over-year. New home orders on our platform\nincreased by 19% outperforming the market, which according to Beike Research Institute declined\nby 6%, both year-over-year. The share of our existing home sales continued to rise with their\nproportion of total home transaction orders on platform increasing from 51% in the first half of\n2021 to 76% in the same period of this year.\nOur competitive edge in the existing home market led to more stable and solid overall business\nperformance. Our agent and store network further expanded. In the first half of the year, various\nhigh-quality industry brands joined our platform, including Guangzhou Hope Real Properties,\nTianjin Boyuan Properties, Wuxi Zhonghuan Real Estate Services and Shenyang Yuemei Properties.\nThe number of active stores on our platform increased by 30% in the first half of the year of\nwhich active non-Lianjia store soared by 36.8%, both year-over-year.fi\nFINAL TRANSCRIPT\n2025-08-26\nKE Holdings Inc (2423 HK Equity)\n© COPYRIGHT 2024, BLOOMBERG LP.

For our existing\nhome transaction services, we continue to deepen and refine our operations, leveraging our\nscientific management system, perform-based operations, and AI-driven technology application\nto boost the store and agent productivity throughout the home listing, customer acquisition and\nconversion process.\nOn home listing side, we have tools like Home Maintenance Score and Exceptional Home product\nto help agent better marketing home listings while focused on top listing to increase transaction\nconversion. On conversion side, we also implemented measures to strengthen store-level\noperation and network operation to enhance matching and transaction efficiency. These\nmeasures included the mechanism like incorporating competition into our store scientific\nmanagement system, deepening the operation of core governance councils. Store point based\nincentive program under designated quality and efficiency business districts.\nIn terms of financial performance, revenue from existing home transactions reached RMB6.7\nbillion in Q2, down 8.4% year-over-year and remaining relatively ﬂlat quarter-over-quarter. GTV\nwas RMB583.5 billion, remaining relatively stable year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter the\nGTV growth outpaced revenue on a year-over-year basis, mainly due to a higher GTV contribution\nfrom the existing home transaction services, facilitated by connected agents for which revenue\nare recorded on a net basis. The contribution margin for the existing home transaction services\nwas 39.9% in Q2, a decline of 7.5 percentage points year-over-year, primarily due to a higher\nfixed labor cost, resulting from an increase in the number of Lianjia agents and the lasting impact\nof the agent welfare improvement strategy we implemented since last year.\nSequentially, the contribution margin grew by 1.8 percentage points due to stronger leverage as\nour series of cost reduction and efficiency enhancement initiatives conducted this year led to a\nquarter-over-quarter decrease in fixed labor costs while revenue remained generally ﬂlat. For our\nnew home construction services, the scale of our collaborative project remained steady. Through\nour AI-driven agent Qianji [ph] will refine the management of new home projects, revitalizing\nmore existing projects.\nOn customer front, we reinforced business synergies between existing new home and rental\nservices and fine-tuned operations while launching our AI assistant Qianzhi [ph] to hub service\nproviders stimulated customer demand and input matching efficiency.\nIn terms of the financial performance, our new home GTV reached RMB255.4 billion in Q2, up\n8.5% year-over-year and 10% quarter-over-quarter. Revenue from new home transaction was\naround RMB8.6 billion in Q2, rising by 8.6% year-over-year and 6.7% quarter-over-quarter.\nRevenue growth was in line with GTV growth year-over-year, demonstrating our steady\nmonetization capabilities in new home transactions.\nWhile GTV growth outpaced the revenue growth sequentially due to the seasonal ﬂluctuation of\nthe peak rate, the contribution margin from the new home transaction services fell by 0.6\npercentage point year-over-year to 24.4% due to an increased variable cost resulting from our\nagent welfare improvement last year.\nSequentially, the new home contribution margin rose by 1 percentage point, largely attributed to\nthe quarter-over-quarter decline in variable cost, thanks to our refined operations and the\nfocusing sales strategy to maximize unit sales for property projects this year. For our home\nrenovation and furniture business, we focus on enhancing the operations to build up our\nunderlying capability to support our sustainable growth. On product capabilities, we analyzed the\nFINAL TRANSCRIPT\n2025-08-26\nKE Holdings Inc (2423 HK Equity)\n© COPYRIGHT 2024, BLOOMBERG LP. All rights reserved.

The proportion of centralized\nprocurement rose markedly, while the overall unit purchase price declined significantly. To further\nimprove our delivery quality, we identified over 2,600 high-quality project managers on our\nplatform, improving their efficiency and income while elevating the end user experience.\nOperationally, we implemented Quality and Efficiency Business District Strategy. We scored\nbusiness district based on the multiple indicators such as building age and housing transaction\nvolume. This allows designers, project managers and other service providers to focus on high\nscore districts, enabling them to gain better -- to gain deeper insight to the customer and the\nproperty conditions. By introducing the upfront site measurements and other process, we\nreshaped workﬂlow to improve operational efficiency. We also accumulated and refined design\nsolutions on the construction guidelines, ultimately enhancing the customer experience.\nIn terms of the financial performance, revenue from our home renovation and furniture business\nreached RMB4.6 billion, increasing by 13% year-over-year. This was mainly driven by the increase\nin home renovation orders alongside with a high average revenue per order stemming from an\nincrease in the average price of furniture and home furnishing retail. Contribution margin for the\nhome renovation and furniture business reached 32.1%, up 0.8 percentage points year-over-year,\nprimarily driven by a larger proportion of centralized procurements and enhanced order\ndispatching efficiency. Sequentially the contribution margin fell by 0.4 percentage points, mainly\nattributable to a structural shift with an increased revenue contribution of furniture and home\nfurnishing retail which has relatively low contribution margin.\nIn our home rental service business, we continued to iterate our products and apply AI to\nrecontrast our business process and operational funnel. On product front, we expanded our\ndifferentiated product portfolio, launching product 09 in the first half of the year to meet\nhomeowners' various needs around the vacancy period and retail income while balancing risk and\nreturns for our business. For unit size and occupancy, we implemented quality-driven lease\nallocation rules so that a better listing and better service provider gets more lease customers will\nalso benefit. We also leveraged AI capability for the intelligent collection and identification of the\nrental housing conditions as well as intelligent pricing to explore a unisubs [ph] model led by the\nplatform AI.\nIn terms of the operational management, we leveraged AI massive computing power to optimize\nresource dispatching, inventory, unisubs and occupancy which enhanced both personal\nproductivity and rental occupancy rates in our pilot regions. In overall, personal productivity\nimproved remarkably in the first half of the year. The average number of the rental unit manager\nper property manager rose significantly which the number of unisubs growing by over 50% in\nJune compared with the same period last year.\nRegarding the financial performance, revenue from our home rental services business reached a\nrecord high of RMB5.7 billion in Q2, up 78% year-over-year, mainly benefiting from the rapid\ngrowth in the number of the rental units on the management. By the end of Q2, we have over\n590,000 rental units under our management compared with over 310,000 in the same period of\n2024. The contribution margin for home rental service was 8.4%, up 2.5 percentage point year-\nover-year and 1.6 percentage points quarter-over-quarter, largely due to the improved grossfifi\nFINAL TRANSCRIPT\n2025-08-26\nKE Holdings Inc (2423 HK Equity)\n© COPYRIGHT 2024, BLOOMBERG LP.

As we continue to refine the Carefree Rent business model\nbased on the extent of the service contract, the revenues from newly managed rental unit were\nrecorded as net revenues derived from the service fee.\nFor Beihaojia business, our strategic direction is very clear and firm. We will never be a developer.\nOur commitment to assets like this model is absolute. Other than Chengdu region and the\nShanghai Fengxian Xincheng project, we will not independently operate any other projects. Our\nrole is to deliver C2M product solution and marketing service for developers and other partners\nin industry and we categorically do not provide any form of fund Solutions. In Q2, our revenue\nfrom emerging and other services decreased by 50.6% year-over-year and grew by 23.5%\nquarter-over-quarter to RMB432 million.\nNow moving to other cost and expenses, profitability, cash ﬂlow and other financial metrics in Q2.\nOur store cost reached RMB762 million, increasing by 11.9% year-over-year and remaining\nrelatively stable quarter-over-quarter. The year-over-year growth was mainly from a higher store\nrepair and maintenance cost. Other costs were RMB588 million, up 15.2% year-over-year and\n7.5% sequentially, primarily due to a higher basic maintenance cost of our home rental service\nbusiness.\nGross profit dropped by 12.5% year-over-year to RMB5.7 billion. Gross margin was 21.9%, down 6\npercentage points year-over-year, primarily due to the decrease in contribution margin from the\nexisting home transaction services. Gross margin increased by 1.2 percentage points sequentially\nin Q2, mainly due to the greater revenue contribution from the home renovation and furniture\nbusiness which has a relatively high contribution margin.\nIn Q2, our GAAP operating expenses totaled RMB4.6 billion, up 3.1% year-over-year and 9.7%\nsequentially. Notably, G&A expenses for RMB2.1 billion, remaining ﬂlat year-over-year and\nincreasing by 11% quarter-over-quarter, primarily attributed to an increase in bad debt provision.\nSales and marketing expenses amounted to RMB1.9 billion, remaining relatively stable year-over-\nyear and growing by 7.1% quarter-over-quarter, primarily resulting from the increased sales and\nmarketing expenses for home renovation and furniture business.\nOur R&D expenses were RMB633 million, up 25.6% year-over-year and 8.5% sequentially, largely\ndriven by a higher personnel cost and the technical service fee. In terms of the profitability, GAAP\nincome from the operations totaled RMB1.06 billion in Q2, down 47.4% from the same period of\nlast year and up 79.4% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating margin was 4.9%, [ph] dropping by 4.5\npercentage points from Q2 2024 and rising by 1.5 percentage points quarter-over-quarter.\nGAAP income from operations totaled RMB1.61 billion, falling by 42.9% from the same period of\nlast year and increasing by 40% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating margin reached 6.2%, down\n5.9 percentage points from Q2 2024, mainly due to a year-over-year gross margin decline. Non-\nGAAP operating margin rose by 1.3 percentage points from the previous quarter, mainly\nattributed to a sequential gross margin improvement.\nGAAP Net income totaled RMB1.31 billion in Q2, down 31.2% year-over-year and up 52.8% quarter-\nover-quarter. Non-GAAP net income was RMB1.82 billion, falling 32.4% year-over-year and\nincreasing 30.7% quarter-over-quarter.\nMoving to our cash ﬂlow on the balance sheet, we generated a net operating cash inﬂlow of\nRMB826 million in Q2. New home DSO reached 51 days in Q2, remaining at healthy level. On top\nof spending approximately $254 million for share repurchase and distributing $400 million for\n2024 final cash dividend during Q2, our total cash liquidity excluding customer deposits payable\nremaining at a high level of around RMB70 billion. With our robust cash reserves, we will continue\nFINAL TRANSCRIPT\n2025-08-26\nKE Holdings Inc (2423 HK Equity)\n© COPYRIGHT 2024, BLOOMBERG LP. All rights reserved.

We have\nconsistently delivered on our promise to reward shareholders. Since launch of a share repurchase\nprogram in September 2022, we have repurchased around $2 billion in shares as of the end of\nJune 2025, accounting for about 10.3% of our total share outstanding before the program began.\nToday, we are pleased to announce that our board has approved an expansion of its new share\nrepurchase program. The authorization has been increased to $5 billion and the program has\nbeen extended to August 31, 2028. Going forward, we will continue to reward our shareholders\nwho have grown with us and shared the value we create.\nDespite ﬂluctuations in macro environment, we have delivered a top line performance that\nsignificantly outperformed the market, underpinned by our solid business fundamentals and a\ndiversified portfolio while actively driving operational improvement to maximize the company's\nlong-term value. AI-driven refined operations and ecosystem optimization are continuously\nunleashing the platform's long-term potential. Our healthy cash ﬂlow and proactive shareholder\nreturn policy demonstrate our firm commitment to long term value creation. Looking ahead, we\nwill join force with all partners and shareholders to seize opportunities and create great value\ntogether.\nThank you. Next, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Mr. Stanley Peng. Go\nahead, sir.\nYongdong Peng {BIO 21921977 <GO>}\nThank you, Tao. For the overview of our updates for the first half of the year, now I'd like to share\nthe reasoning behind our initiatives and address some key interests and concerns. First, I'd like to\ntalk about scale and efficiency. For our housing transaction services business, we have expanded\nour agent and store network very rapidly over the past few years. In the first half of the year, a\nlarge number of new brands, stores and agents joined our network. However, we saw some\nsoftness in our efficiency indicators in housing transaction services in the second quarter.\nOur ACN and authentic listing were originally built to solve the key consumer pain points of that\ntime. But as China's real estate market evolved, consumer needs changed dramatically and our\nresponse didn't fully meet those emerging needs. This created an urgent need for us to shift our\ngrowth engine from scale to efficiency. The main challenger we cleared was clear how would we\nraise productivity per store and per agent and increase platform efficiency while maintaining the\nscale of our agent and store network. Resolving this will define the next stage of our\ndevelopment.\nTo begin with, I want to stress that scale and efficiency are not a zero sum trade-off. Gaining\nefficiency doesn't mean sacrificing scale. Reaching the current scale of our agent and store\nnetwork was no small feat. You'd be hard pressed to find a comparable example anywhere in the\nworld of a company that has reached such a large presence in a single city through its own\noperations.\nSo how did we accomplish it? In the past, the scarcest resources in the market were high-quality\nassets and transaction security guarantees. That is why we built our ACN and introduced\nauthentic listings and service commitments, integrating online platform innovation, offline\nbusiness execution, and disciplined scientific management to support them. By providing what\nwas scarce, we achieved a breakthrough in scale and built a deep competitive moat.ffifi\nFINAL TRANSCRIPT\n2025-08-26\nKE Holdings Inc (2423 HK Equity)\n© COPYRIGHT 2024, BLOOMBERG LP. All rights reserved. Any reproduction, redistribution or retransm ission is expressly prohibited.\nPrinted on 08-26-2025 Page 6 of 16\nSo how do we move from scale to efficiency? First, by looking at our history, we need to find out\nthe existing strengths that we can leverage while acquiring new capabilities for today's context.\nSecond by responding to consumers' evolving needs in China's changing real estate market. The\nnew scarce resources are accurate market insights to help buyers make the right decisions,\noperational capabilities to help sellers market properties effectively, and the emotional value that\ncomes from emphasizing with customers. Buyers want professional advice, homeowners need\nskilled marketing support, and in the age of AI, consumers emotional connection. Our task is to\ncreate clear pathways to deliver these values.\nAs we seek a new growth heritage, we start by challenging a paradox. Large organizations often\nsacrifice efficiency to pursue scale. We already have the drives for efficiency improvements. First,\nthe transformation of customer demands acts as a natural form of selection. Second, AI-led\ninnovation is delivering real productivity gains as a new means of production. AI is becoming\nincreasingly powerful, capable of replacing traditional means of production. These two factors --\ntwo forces enable us to raise efficiency while maintaining the scale of our agent and store\nnetwork. Our end game is clear, but how we get there is still being defined. Going forward, we\nwill commit our energy and resources to those areas to reshape our growth path.\nNow I'd like to dive into the logic behind some of the business initiatives we are working on. I will\nstart with the home renovation business. As Tao mentioned, our strategy center on community-\ncentric operations and our full services premium store model. Our rationale reﬂlects a major\nemerging trend. It's a shift from a traffic-driven mindset to a local community-centric approach.\nWe have begun piloting this model throughout our first full services home renovation premium\nstore in Beijing.\nIn the premium store, we put in showrooms with our modular renovation products so potential\ncustomers can see real replicable home renovations based on typical local ﬂloor plans in a\ncommunity. Our organizational structure has adapted accordingly. Designers, project managers,\nand workers are now dedicated to specific communities, gain knowledge and experience of both\nproperties and customers there. The key here is to deepen our engagement, locking in high\nvalue areas and strengthening our presence to become customer's first choice in the region,\nultimately occupying their mind share.\nOur goal is to bridge the distance between our services and the users. We want to bring them\ncloser physically, psychologically, and in decision making so we can evolve from a city-level\nrenovation service provider to a community-level partner whose interests are deeply aligned with\nthe customers. Specifically, by opening our home renovation premium store adjacent to our\nexisting home transaction contract signing centers, we have reduced the physical distance to our\ncustomers. This tell our customers we are the neighbor right down the street, not a large distant\ncompany they have to drive an hour to reach. This builds trust and convenience at the same time.\nOur community-based premium store and community-specific service providers are well versed\nin the ﬂloor plans and customer needs so they can offer tailored home renovation design plans\neven before customers purchase homes. This shorten the decision making distance for\ncustomers.\nWhy is it? Because the biggest pain points in traditional home renovation is uncertainty.\nCustomers often don't know the final costs, what their homes will look like or whether the service\nwill be reliable. We solve this with two innovative services, community showroom designs and\npre-signing measurements and drawing. Community showrooms design say to potential\ncustomers your neighbor's home with the same ﬂloor plan as yours has already been renovated\nFINAL TRANSCRIPT\n2025-08-26\nKE Holdings Inc (2423 HK Equity)\n© COPYRIGHT 2024, BLOOMBERG LP.

No guesswork is needed. Our pre-\nsigning measurement and drawing ﬂlips the traditional payments first, service later model.\nWe demonstrate value upfront by providing professional measuring and design renderings\nbefore customers commit. This gives people great security and confidence right from the start.\nOur strategy also reduce the psychological distance for users with our physical store, proven\ncases, and a professional consulting team in the community. Our brand is no longer a cold,\nimpersonal and white advertisement. It becomes a real tangible presence customers can interact\nwith anytime. The assets we gain from this kind of deepening operational are more powerful than\nmarketing, turning one-time transactional customers into long term interactive community users.\nThese are just some of the ways we think about our initiatives in the home renovation business.\nNext I'd like to talk about how we view the home rental business. Tao has already covered much\nof our progress in this segment, including product interaction and a broader user of AI to boost\nproperty management efficiency and streamline other operations. Why do we pursue maximum\nefficiency in this business? Because, under the traditional management model, our Carefree\nRental business inevitably faces these economics of scale. Once the numbers of units reach a\ncertain level, complexity may rise sharply due to the non-standard nature of our products, the\nservice provider abilities and sales negotiations. At the same time, the rental business operates\non the service fee profit margin which cannot absorb losses from non-standard operations and\nlow efficiency. These three major challenges from Iron Triangle that it compels us to break\nthrough the traditional model and pursue maximum operational efficiency.\nSo how do we achieve maximum efficiency? In phase one, we restructured our organization,\nmoving away from the all-in-one manager model to six specialized roles, fully aligned with the\nlogical of our ACN. This division improved professional skills, reduced services variants, and\nembedded its capabilities into our platform.\nIn phase two, we optimized our product model, shifting from the high-risk, non-standard,\nvacancy-prone, lease-out model to our steady rent pass through model with unified service fees.\nThis stabilized revenue per property, aligned team goals and removed the obstacles for scaling\ngoals. We also digitalized process through our SaaS system, accumulating structured data to fuel\nAI applications.\nIn phase three, we begin to build intelligence into operations, deploying our AI human model\nwhere AI handles standardization, pricing, auditing and 24/7 virtual services. We hope that AI\ncould cover 80% of standardized work while people can focus on trust in regular cases and high\nquality services. The logic tying all of this together is about transforming a non-standardized\noffline industry, full of uncertainty into a data and intelligence-driven business with more\ncertainties. At its core, our system reduced reliance on individual experience, smoothing our\nﬂluctuations in service quality and customer experience. Efficient operations and consistent service\nquality creates a growth ﬂlywheel, reinforcing synergies across the home rental business, home\nrenovation and housing transactions.\nOur vision is to build an AI-driven rental platform by combining AI, IoT, hardware and operating\nprocesses. We hope this platform will give the rental industry a proven and scalable profit model.\nMeanwhile, the pursuit of operational excellence will inevitably compel our whole organization to\ndevelop more efficient operational mechanisms. We also hope it can be an example for the\ntraditional service industry, showing how structure, model design and technology can solve issues\nlike non-standardized, natural and this -- economics of scale.\nFINAL TRANSCRIPT\n2025-08-26\nKE Holdings Inc (2423 HK Equity)\n© COPYRIGHT 2024, BLOOMBERG LP.

Why are we pursuing this business? We will not be\ndevelopers. To be clear, we will not be adopting an asset-heavy model. The traditional real estate\ndeveloper business used to depend on land and money. In today's market, there is a new\nvariable, a customer-oriented mindset. Because we are so close to our customers, we can collect\nmore customer insights and data to add value to this third variable. In the early stage of this\nbusiness, we ran two self-operated projects to test our understanding and to see what value we\ncould create for this third factor.\nGenuine customer needs at the very core of our product design and construction. We leverage\nour robust data and AI power capabilities including pricing, prediction, unit mix optimization and\npotential customer insights to deeply understand our target customer needs. Our project\npositioning, product design and construction adheres to this authentic customer needs, including\nmany small details traditional developers might overlook, but that we consider critical to long-\nterm living experience.\nIn our Chengdu Fengxian project, we have dedicated meticulous design and construction efforts\nto over 108 quality-driven details that many things are minor yet meaningful. This spans from\nurban integration of architecture, design, landscape planning, homecoming journey experiences,\ninterior spatial planning to AI, IoT-enabled sensory system covering sight, sound, smell, taste,\ntouch, consciousness as well as lifestyle scenarios and property services. This productization\ncapability is something that's becoming crucial as the market shift to buyers. This means the\nsupply side must offer differentiated, not homogeneous products and this is how we add value to\nthe industry through the third variable of production beyond land and money.\nFinally, we now stand at crucial turning points. Balancing scale and efficiency, adapting to evolve\ncustomer demands, and keeping path with rapid technology development are all issues we must\naddress. We have already started exploring and testing new approaches across our business.\nWhile maintaining the scale advantage of our platform, we aim to revamp our service interface\nthrough community-centric operations, unlock organizational efficiencies with AI, rebuild our\nproduct logic with a customer-centric mindset, and continuously shape new paradigms in the\nresidential service industry.\nThis concludes my prepared remarks for today.

Thank you, management, for taking my question and congrats on the solid result and very\nexcited to hear about your new approach in growing the business in future. I think my question is\non the secondary home. I'm just wondering if management can provide us any overview on the\nsecond quarter secondary home market and how should we expect the trajectory into the\nsecond half of this year? What kind of policy tools that we can expect for the rest of this year\nnow?

The total value of\nthe housing transaction nationwide was stable. Overall, the market was of to a good start in Q1,\nsustaining the recovery momentum from Q4 of last year. But both number and the price of\ntransaction weakened significantly in this Q2. Divergence also intensified.\nBased on NBS data, new home sales nationwide dropped by 5.2% year-over-year in the first half.\nCRIC research indicates the top 100 developers saw steeper declines, posting 10.9% in the first\nhalf sales, slide that intensified to 14.5% year-over-year in this Q2. The existing home market\nholds up relatively well. According to Beike Research Institute, in the first half, the total value of\nonline registered transaction for existing homes rose 8.3% year-over-year. This was driven by a\n19% increase in the number of transactions even though average price fell by 9% both year-over-\nyear. That aside, momentum slowed in this Q2. The transaction volume growth rate dipped to just\n2% and the number of transactions also slipped to 12% again.\nIn June, the number of transactions decreased by 8% year-over-year and the home prices\ndropped further month-over-month by 1.7%. Rent has been more stable than home prices.\nNationwide rental yield has been steadily rebounding since year of 2021. In June this year, it\nreached a higher of 2.5%, about 40% higher than its lowest point, creating value support for the\nhome prices. Structurally, existing home continued to perform better than new homes. Existing\nhome transactions tended to have a large average GFA, lower total price and a higher share of\nthe nearly new existing homes. Population movement from lower to higher tier cities remained\nsteady and we continue to see wild differences across cities in terms of the housing price,\ninventory sell-through and the land auction premiums.\nOur key indicators like homeowner price adjustment, prosperity index and agent confidence\nindex shows a weak market sentiment. The feeding efforts of the new policies, China-US trade\ntensions shortened the policy workings and the system market correction set to market\nmomentum. Reinforced expectations for price declines constrained market recovery. All of this\nadd to a strong downward pressure for the market. Since beginning of July, the market downturn\nhas picked up speed. The number of existing home transactions fell by over 5% month-over-\nmonth while the prices dropped by 1.5%. New home subscriptions fell by 25% month-over-month,\nsignaling a period of sharp correction.\nLooking ahead, the market path will still depend on the pace of the future policies and the supply\ndemand balance improvement. Both are key to restore the confidence which in turn inﬂluence\nbuying behavior and price trend. On June 30, the State Council executive meeting once again\nemphasized the need to double-down on stabilizing the market, signaling the potential for\nstronger policy support. On top of current policies that remain in place, there is still room for new\nstronger policies aimed at boosting demand and improve supply.\nOn demand side, leading cities have further relaxed purchase restrictions. Urban renewal,\nrelocation vouchers and purchase subsidy can also unlock potential home-buying demand. On\nsupply side, high-quality housing from the fourth generation houses and the nearly new existing\nhome supply enables the easing of sales restrictions, could elevate supply side quality and\npotentially market sentiment and transaction volume. Proactive policy can help counteract the\nmarket downward trend and support a shift towards recovery.\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Your next question comes from John Lam from UBS. Please go ahead.\nFINAL TRANSCRIPT\n2025-08-26\nKE Holdings Inc (2423 HK Equity)\n© COPYRIGHT 2024, BLOOMBERG LP. All rights reserved.

(Foreign Language) So let me translate my question in English. So could management\nshare about, under the backdrop of the sector downturn regarding the property sector, is there\nanything that the management team has done to deliver the offer to the investors? For example,\nwould be like the market share agents productivity or store productivity and also how does the\nmanagement think about the growth strategy for both the agents and the number of store?\nThank you.\nA - Tao Xu {BIO 21921984 <GO>}\nJohn, thank you for question. We hope to offer for market for a long time to come and have\ntaken steps to achieve that. I will answer a question from two angles, skill and efficiency. First, the\ncontinuous expansion of our platform agent store network over past few years has fueled fast\nbusiness growth. Going forward, we will slow the pace of our store and agent growth and focus\nmore on efficiency or sustainable development. This strategy will vary by city. In places where\nstore network coverage is already high, we will impose higher quality and ROI requirements to\nonboard new stores.\nIn few cities where store network coverage is still relatively low, we will continue to make a\nstrategic investment. At the end of the year, we expect to keep our store and agent number\nstable outside of Beijing and Shanghai. In those two cities where agent growth has been strong\nover the past few years, while consolidating lower-performing stores and phasing out lower-\nperforming agents, I believe it's time to shift our growth focus from scale to efficiency, starting\nwith deeper operation efforts in the short term.\nIn the long term, we expect the technology to drive the industrywide gains in total factor\nproductivity. In details, we will implement in-depth systematic scientific management operations,\nparticularly by enhancing operations that add competitive dimensions. This involves manager\nprocess that inﬂluence competitive outcomes such as focusing on properties, customers and\nimproving collaboration and matching to enhance the competitiveness of individual store on our\nplatform. And we will also continue to strengthen our key operation initiatives such as our points-\nbased store incentive system, regional core governance councils, management of high-quality\nbusiness districts and separation of agent role for homeowners and buyers which we piloted in\nShanghai.\nThese projects are helping us improve our ecosystem and guide service provider behavior. For\nexample, store in high-quality business district had a 1.44 times the average productivity of\naverage stores compared with less than 1.4 times in the second half of 2024. Over the long term,\ntechnology will be key to enhancing our efficiency and consistently delivering alpha. We see the\nadvance in large AI model technology combined with our unique scenarios and data in residential\nservice sector have strong potential in reshaping user experience, boosting efficiency. To bring\ntransformation in the real estate industry, we have established the AI project metrics that develop\ndifferent AI applications simultaneously for different roles on our CN and BS [ph] on both strategic\nand operational levels.\nSome of these applications have demonstrated good results. One example is our AIGC\nmarketing and AI-driven CRM products that address customer acquisition and the conversion of\nagents. We have built an intelligent AIGC marketing agent for real estate agents to support\ncustomer acquisition through self media, private domain traffic operations and lead conversion. It\noffers a full set of tools help agents create a multimodel content for multi-channel customerfi\nFINAL TRANSCRIPT\n2025-08-26\nKE Holdings Inc (2423 HK Equity)\n© COPYRIGHT 2024, BLOOMBERG LP.

Here I refer to the brokerage agent as brokers to avoid any confusion. For\nexisting home brokers, our AI CRM improves customer management through our constantly\nevolving multi-agent system, powered by our user data, it gives the brokers personnel guidance\nranging from market insight and customer strategy to recommended actions. This input helps\nbrokers understand users' needs, gauge their intentions and spots new opportunities. It also\nautomate personalized follow-up tasks to drive transactions.\nBut end of June 2025, (inaudible) one of our AI-driven CRM product application was in use across\n59 cities with over 335,000 brokers. The product penetration rate exceeded 75% across Beijing\nand Shanghai. In Xi'an, for example, brokers who use Beike extensively achieved a 30% higher\nconversion rate for final customer mandates and about 20% higher conversion rate for showing\ncompared with brokers that use the product less frequently.\nFor new homes, we have AI-driven CRM agent Qianji and Qianzhi that help new home sales\nmanagers improve listing management efficiency and strengthen both matching and marketing\nfor new home products. On our consumer side, for example, our Pudding AI online services\nsystem now provides real estate market analysis, citywide home search, regional analysis, home\nlisting comparisons, preliminary matching for home listing and agents. We began green box\ntesting in May, making Pudding available to select users in 11 cities. In July, this MAU reached\n780,000, up 10% from June. Commercial volume grew by 59% and average time spent per user\nwas up 14%. Pudding now supports multi-language, multi-model services while also transforming\nPudding to allow it to proactively explore customer needs and handle tasks while providing more\nprecise, high quality instructive answers. This enhancement will help user make decision and\nmove transaction forward. Pudding is our first 2C trial in offering AI-powered services and we are\nmaking extensive efforts to offer more intelligent services to the industry. We believe AI is the\nmost crucial driver for our next generation productivity improvements. We will keep you posted\non our internal progress.\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Your next question comes from Griffin Chan from Citi, Please.\nQ - Griffin Chan {BIO 17610746 <GO>}\n(Foreign Language) So my question is about how will the property new development model such\nas company's property sales or promote of the quality house create new opportunity for Beike,\nfor example, in demand forecast or even for the product design? Thank you.\nA - Tao Xu {BIO 21921984 <GO>}\nThank you, Griffin. This year supply side policy in real estate have accelerated in pushing better\nliving quality, especially through high quality homes and moving ready new homes. These\nmeasures are being implemented at a fast pace. Residential products that meet new national\nstandards have performed well and the pilot sales of the moving ready new homes in Xinyang\nhave set a good example. Surveys show that among the factors holding back buyers, price\nexpectation accounted for nearly 50%, while home suitability accounts for around 20%.\nFINAL TRANSCRIPT\n2025-08-26\nKE Holdings Inc (2423 HK Equity)\n© COPYRIGHT 2024, BLOOMBERG LP. All rights reserved. Any reproduction, redistribution or retransm ission is expressly prohibited.\nPrinted on 08-26-2025 Page 12 of 16\nAs new home products better meet home upgrades, suitability demands and the system for\nselling moving ready new home gradually expands, we expect to see reduced quantity and input\nquality supply. This new model set much higher requirements on developers from securing\nfunding and ensure project returns to understanding upgrade needs, project positioning and\npricing and the sales marketing. This will further highlight the value of Beike bring to developers.\nIn terms of the impact of the current brokerage model, in the short term, in four tier cities, new\nhome products that met the new standards will have a lower brokerage sales proportion and\ncommission rate than the products under the old standard. Nevertheless, in most cities, new\nstandard products currently only accounted for around 10% of units and their presence will push\nold standard products to reach their brokerage service penetration ratio. As a consequence of\nthis, the overall impact on the broker channel sales market is gradually small. When new standard\nproducts make up over 30% of the project launch in the city, for example, as they do in Xi'an, the\nbrokerage penetration and commission rate will match those of old standard products.\nThe fast sell-through of the new regulation products can boost agents' confidence in new home\nproducts forming a virtuous cycle. Opportunities for cooperation model upgrades, the industry\nnew model will also drive upgrades in how we work with developer beyond the broker channel\nsales model. Our goal is to offer the tailored service for managing the full project life cycle based\non each developer's needs and project type. This will further highlight the value of Beihaojia\nbusiness from its C2M product solution to its integrated online and offline marketing services.\nPricing forecast capability. We leverage systematic modeling approach including a subjective\nfactor eliminated pricing model with a rolling review and the calibration mechanism and the\ncomparable price trend analysis based on authentic existing home market data. Our algorithm\nsets out structured factors so that the prices are comparable both across market and over time.\nThis pricing capability helps developers objectively exercise price trends and set accurate prices,\navoiding profit loss from the mispricing.\nWhen competition in selling moving ready new home intensified, it can also improve the project\nvalue for money positioning. For example, in Nanjing and Wuhan, new standard products are\nnoticeably more competitive, exhibiting independent price trends. Beike's price forecasting\ncapability enable granular segmentation analysis to better characterize some market dynamics.\nToday our pricing model already have a fairly high level of accuracy.\nRegarding the unit mix forecasting capability, we apply matching learning algorithm to model and\nforecast customers' housing unit needs, drawing on both potential customer behavior and\nhistorical transaction data. In June 2025, the compliance rate of our sample simulations continued\nto rise. Our goal for the year of 2026 is to have a full product and market coverage to help\ndevelopers plan unit mixes more accurately, avoid inventory buildup and speed up sales of\nmoving ready new homes.\nRegarding the customer insights, we can clearly define and pinpoint potential customer for\nbuilding projects in specific district along with their needs and profiles. This includes identifying\ntheir purchasing power, preferred housing unit type, location, age, purchase purpose, finance\nsize and so on. Using our potential customer model, we can forecast the high price intent buyers\nin the next 90 days for any given district and their specific needs. This gives developers the\ninformation they need to enhance competitiveness by targeting the right demographic and\ndesign optimizing products that meet the new standard requirements.\nAt the current stage, we hope to help developers position their products accurately at early\nstage, reducing the cost of the late stage adjustments and improving product alignment with\nFINAL TRANSCRIPT\n2025-08-26\nKE Holdings Inc (2423 HK Equity)\n© COPYRIGHT 2024, BLOOMBERG LP.

Looking ahead, we will focus on building customization and community\noperation capabilities to help developers standout in the moving ready new home market. By\ncomplementing developers with our strength in moving ready new home sales through\nregulatory adoption and the bottom line production, our value to developer will extend from\nbrokerage to product source. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Your next question comes from Daniel Chen from JPMorgan. Please.\nQ - Daniel Chen {BIO 20875028 <GO>}\n(Foreign Language) So my question is on the home renovation and furnishing business. We have\nseen that the margin improvement has been strong on year-over-year basis and revenue growth\nis healthy. So what's the key growth driver behind? Is there further room for cost optimization?\nMeanwhile, are we going to expand the city coverage or are we going to further optimize our\nstore network? Thank you.\nA - Tao Xu {BIO 21921984 <GO>}\nThank you, Daniel. The home renovation and furnishing business maintained a relatively high\ngrowth rate in the first half of this year. Scale-wise, its revenue reached RMB7.51 billion, up 16.5%\nyear-over-year. On the profitability front, the segment profit margin was 32.3% in the first half of\nthe year, rising by 1.3 percentage points from the same period last year. Operational efficiency\nalso improved significantly at the city level in Q2. Operational efficiency enhancement is the focus\nof our home renovation business this year. We have implemented a series of initiatives aimed at\nenhancing fundamentals like our product and delivery capability, streamlining our organizational\nstructure and amplifying management and operational efficiency. These efforts have led to\ncontinuous improvements in our performance.\nHere I'd like to elaborate. In terms of cost, the home renovation business expense mainly include\nmaterial and labor costs. For materials, we cut procurement cost by consolidating brands and\nSKUs and moving to centralized procurement by leveraging customer insight to streamline brand\nselection and SKU counts. We have consolidated procurement to three or few brands for most\ncategories and achieved significant SKU reduction. Centralized procurement rate for primary and\nauxiliary materials reached more than 60% in Q2 2025 compared with over 20% in the same\nperiod of last year. This increased procurement value -- volume for SKU in each category has led\nto a significant decrease in the unit price of some products that were awarded contracts.\nOn the labor side, we have improved service providers' work efficiency by optimizing our order\ndispatching rules, enhancing the system order distribution capability and focusing project\nmanager service area on specific business districts. Also, we are allocating more resources to\nhigh-quality service providers. In Q2 2025, average monthly order intake per professional project\nmanager was more than double last year's average, driving significant improvement in both their\nefficiency and income.\nIn terms of the sales and marketing expenses, this mainly covers the sales personnel cost for\ndesigners and customer managers and store and property channel cost. As a percentage of\nrevenue, sales personnel costs for designers and other roles significantly decreased year-over-\nyear primarily due to our agile transformation of the home renovation business organization\nstructure. We streamlined the design team, optimized the overall home renovation business\nworkﬂlow, eliminated certain roles in sales process and shifted the functions towards agents. Our\ndigital tools such as AI proposal and lightweight BIM have significantly improved operationalffi\nFINAL TRANSCRIPT\n2025-08-26\nKE Holdings Inc (2423 HK Equity)\n© COPYRIGHT 2024, BLOOMBERG LP.

The average monthly order volume for designers has increased\nfrom around 0.8 order last year to over 1.2 orders in the second quarter of this year.\nTo optimize store cost, we closed some underperforming large stores and piloted small size\npremium home renovation store near our home transaction contract signing center where we\nintegrated master design prioritized showrooms. We hope to strengthen the synergy between\nour housing transaction business at the new issue initiatives, reducing store cost and improving\nsales per unit area while exploring a new one-stop full service home renovation model\nFor G&A expenses, we also made some structural enhancements, responding service scope of\nmiddle and back office personnel. The average number of orders supported by each middle and\nback office personnel increased by 70% year-over-year in this country. This initiative enable us to\nachieve a better operational result while continuously improving the service quality. In Q2, this\nyear the customer complaint rate of our home renovation and furniture business dropped to\nbelow 10% from over 25% in the same period last year.\nWe have seen a significant improvement in bringing the unit economies at the city level. In Beijing\narea, revenue increased from over RMB700 million in the first half of 2023 to RMB1.15 billion in the\nfirst half of 2024 and exceeded RMB1.5 billion in the first half of this year, representing a year-\nover-year growth rate over 30%. The gross profit margin in the first half of 2023, 2024 and 2025\nwere 35%, 36.1%, and 36.3%, respectively. The operational margin at the city level rose from\naround 5% in the first half of 2023 to over 11% in the same period of 2025. The remarkable\nimprovement in the model cities' UE has boosted our confidence in the business continuous\noperation and the future success. There are still plenty of room for the operational efficiency\nimprovement. Moving forward, our focus will shift from organizational structure optimization this\nyear to implementing ongoing innovation in business models, products, and technology.\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Your next question comes from Xiaodan Zhang from CICC. Please go.\nQ - Xiaodan Zhang {BIO 21109231 <GO>}\n(Foreign Language) So thanks management for taking my questions and we know that since its\nlaunch in the end of 2023, Beihaojia has brought a number of projects to the market.
