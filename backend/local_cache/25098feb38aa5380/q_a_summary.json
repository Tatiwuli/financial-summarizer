Music/pop-culture integration, storytelling, and animation innovation key. Music from the film is driving fandom; more original animated titles coming later this year. No explicit commitment to a specific subgenre mix."}]}, {"name": "Vikram", "firm": "Baird", "questions": [{"question": "How have U.S. advertisers responded to the Netflix Ad Suite rollout since April? Which features draw most interest, and what is the early feedback internationally?", "answer_summary": "Co-CEO said Netflix’s in-house ad stack is now fully rolled out across all ad markets globally; rollout was smooth with good performance metrics meeting expectations. Key near-term benefit is easier buying (confirmed by advertiser feedback) and increased programmatic. Additional demand sources (e.g., Yahoo) to expand reach. Owning the stack accelerates roadmap: improved targeting/measurement, leveraging advertiser/3P data, better ad personalization, and adding interactivity in 2H25. Results in line with plan across regions."}]}, {"name": "Doug Anmuth", "firm": "JPMorgan", "questions": [{"question": "Given strong 2H slate (e.g., Wednesday, Stranger Things) and hits like Squid Game, is Netflix currently hit-driven? Can original and licensed momentum continue into 2026?", "answer_summary": "Co-CEO said growth benefits from big hits but single titles typically drive ≤1% of total viewing; success depends on consistent drumbeat across series, films, and soon games. Highlighted 44 Emmy-nominated shows and robust 2H25 slate (including Happy Gilmore 2, new Knives Out) and a deep 2026 pipeline across films and global series (e.g., Narnia by Greta Gerwig, Enola Holmes 3, Bridgerton, One Piece, Avatar: The Last Airbender, regional hits). Confident momentum extends into 2026."}]}, {"name": "Rich Greenfield", "firm": "LightShed Partners", "questions": [{"question": "Are you concerned about stagnation in U.S. viewing share (Nielsen Gauge)? Do you need to spend more or differently to move share higher?", "answer_summary": "Co-CEO said objective is to grow share long term; maintained share despite more competitors, paid sharing effects, and back-half-weighted 2025 slate. As linear shifts to streaming (≈50% of TV still linear), Netflix will keep improving the service. Content amortization up >50% since 2020 (to >$16B in 2025) alongside higher revenue, profit, and margins. Strategy is to sustain healthy revenue growth, reinvest to enhance the offering, and drive engagement, revenue, and profit globally."}, {"question": "Why is the new UI/UX important as you expand live, and what metrics have improved since launch?", "answer_summary": "Co-CEO said the new TV UI, now rolled to the first large device wave, is outperforming prelaunch tests after iteration; pace of improvement increases confidence across metrics like faster discovery and reduced failed sessions (implied; specific metrics not disclosed). Prior UI was built for Netflix of a decade ago; new UI supports broader catalog including games and live, uses real-time recommendations that adapt to context, and helps drive appointment-like viewing for live. Management confident this platform better meets business needs going forward."}]}, {"name": "Alan Gould", "firm": "Loop Capital", "questions": [{"question": "Provide more detail on the TF1 partnership in France. Why TF1 as first partner, why now, and should we expect similar partnerships elsewhere?", "answer_summary": "Co-CEO said the goal is to expand the entertainment offering with highly relevant local-for-local content in a market with strong local demand. Timing driven by enabling capabilities now in place (live, ads, new UI). Chose TF1 as leading local programmer in a big territory, with strong alignment and mutual value potential; both sides aim to scale TF1 local content to more French customers. Will learn from consumer response before deciding on expansion. No explicit confirmation of similar deals elsewhere."}]}, {"name": "Robert Fishman", "firm": "MoffettNathanson", "questions": [{"question": "With Apple pursuing F1 and other rights, how is Netflix approaching sports rights and what moves the needle for you?", "answer_summary": "Co-CEO said live strategy extends beyond sports and is unchanged: focus on ownable, breakthrough events that fans love and that make economic sense. Live is a small share of spend and viewing but drives outsized conversation, acquisition, and likely retention. Current slate includes Canelo vs. Crawford in September, SAG Awards, weekly WWE, and NFL Christmas Day doubleheader (DAL-WAS, DET-MIN). Live has been primarily U.S. so far; will grow capabilities globally over time. No shift toward broad, expensive rights."}]}, {"name": "Michael Morris", "firm": "Guggenheim", "questions": [{"question": "As Netflix broadens content (live sports, TF1), is there a path to additional tiers based on content types, or will all content remain available at ad-free and ad-supported price points?", "answer_summary": "Co-CEO said never say never and remains open to evolving the model. Principles: offer member choice across price points; maintain accessibility globally; ensure reasonable and growing returns to reinvest. Must balance value with complexity. Expect the “bundle” of broad entertainment at a reasonable price to remain a key feature for the foreseeable future."}]}, {"name": "Justin Patterson", "firm": "KeyBanc", "questions": [{"question": "Discuss your generative AI initiatives. Where will GenAI be most impactful over time, revenue or expense efficiency?", "answer_summary": "Co-CEO said AI is an opportunity to help creators make content better, not just cheaper. In production/VFX, AI tools delivered a building-collapse sequence 10x faster and cost-effectively in an Argentine series—the first GenAI final footage on a Netflix original—via EyeLine (production innovation group within Scanline). Co-CEO added GenAI will enhance member experience via improved personalization and conversational discovery, boosting the return on content spend; also advertising creative at scale. Netflix believes it has data/scale advantages to leverage GenAI across creation, discovery, and ads."}]}, {"name": "Brian Pitz", "firm": "BMO Capital Markets", "questions": [{"question": "With GTA partnerships and the Roblox agreement, what are near-term gaming monetization opportunities?", "answer_summary": "Co-CEO said near-term monetization mirrors other new content categories: drive acquisition, retention, and willingness to pay as games add value. Early positive proof points from licensed (GTA) and developed titles (Squid Game Unleashed). Investment remains small and will scale with demonstrated impact; more licensed, first-party, and interactive experiences coming over the next year. Open to evolving monetization later, but need much larger scale first; long-term TAM is very large."}]}, {"name": "Jessica Reif Erlich", "firm": "BofA Securities", "questions": [{"question": "Given your balance sheet and potential media M&A wave, what kinds of assets would strengthen your moat? View on owning IP or studio assets coming to market?", "answer_summary": "CFO said industry consolidation likely, but legacy media combinations don’t materially change Netflix’s competitive landscape. Netflix is more builder than buyer and sees ample organic growth runway. M&A lens: size of opportunity, enhancement to offering/capabilities, acceleration of strategy, and opportunity cost. No interest in owning legacy media networks, narrowing the funnel. Expect to stay choosy, prioritize organic investment, and return excess cash via buybacks."}]}]}}
