Read through all the \"EVALUATION CRITERIAS\" , \"KEY DEFINITIONS\" , and \"FUNDAMENTAL RULES\" to understand what and how to evaluate a <SUMMARY>\n3.Evaluate every single information of the <SUMMARY> based on the \"EVALUATION_CRITERIAS\" , step by step.\n4.Write the evaluation results in the format specified in the \"OUTPUT STRUCTURE\"\n\n##EVALUATION CRITERIAS\n- Factuality: Are all the information, including quantitative and qualitative metrics and insights extracted from the transcript?\n- Metric Accuracy: Are all the quantifiable and qualitative metrics precisely correct from the transcript?\nQuestion accuracy: Are the questions correctly representing what was asked. even if omitting some parts that are not significant for the analysts' sentiment and contextualization?\n- Metric specificity: When a metric is mentioned, is it specifically associated with the metric and/or product/service?\n - Question Completedness : are all questions, including the sub-questions nested in one question, included in the summary?\n- Question grouping: Are related sub-questions of an analyst grouped into one block , and the different ones separated?\nAnswer Completedness: is all \"Key Information\" of an answer captured in the summary. See below what forms a \"Key Information\"\n\n##KEY DEFINITIONS\n###Definition of a KEY INFORMATION that should be included in a summary:\n-Any quantified metrics that impacted a financial result\n-Any significant changes in the company's management, strategy, investment, , roadmap, or production\n-Any reference to investors' questions or financial results and KPIs in the question, even if it was already mentioned by other analysts\n-Any significant changes in customer behavior and/or product/service performance , characteristics, or production\n-Any explicitly stated guidance, outlook, opportunity , and risk\n-Any **explicit** sentiment conveyed in an executive's answer and analyst's question. Not all answers or questions will convey a sentiment explicitly enough to do a sentiment analysis.\nWhen an executive didn't replied directly to the question\n\n\n\n##FUNDAMENTAL RULES\n- Single ground truth is from the transcript provided by the user in the following messages.\n- Do not depend on the information of the summaries nor outside sources. Consider that the transcript is your single source of truth\n- Focus on evaluating the **content** of the summary, ignore the structure of the headings and bullet points.\n\n##Your output should follow the structure specified in the \"OUTPUT STRUCTURE\" below:\n-If the provided summary successfully meets a criteria, return \"True\" for that criteria.\n-If any information doesn't meet a criteria, respond with \"False\" and provide detailed error information.\n\n## Output Structure\nOutput your response as valid JSON following this exact structure:\n```json\n{OUTPUT_STRUCTURE}\n```\n\nEvery metric in the 'EVALUATION CRITERIAS' should reperesent one dict object in the output. IMPORTANT:\n- Output ONLY valid JSON, no additional text\n- For passed criteria, set \"passed\": true and \"errors\": []\n- For failed criteria, set \"passed\": false and include detailed error objects in the \"errors\" array\n- Each error object must have \"error\", \"summary_text\", and \"transcript_text\" fields\n- Ensure all JSON strings are properly escaped",

Your mission is to evaluate a Q&A SUMMARY strictly against the provided TRANSCRIPT using the criteria below to help analysts spot misinformation and missing insights.\n\nGuiding principles\n\n- Single source of truth: Use only the provided transcript. Ignore outside knowledge.\n- Scope: Evaluate only the given SUMMARY vs the given TRANSCRIPT. Do not compare across other summaries or prior outputs.\n- Attribution-first: Determine who is speaking. Treat content under Q as Analyst premise/question; content under A as Company answer. Do not penalize analyst premises under factuality/metric accuracy. Assess analyst premises under question-focused criteria only.\n- Ambiguity handling: If the transcript includes a number without metric type (e.g., ARR vs revenue), the SUMMARY passes if it preserves ambiguity (e.g., repeats the figure without assigning a type). Penalize only if the SUMMARY assigns an incorrect/unsupported type.\n- Conservative reading: Prefer the least speculative interpretation that does not unfairly penalize the SUMMARY.\n- Materiality: Flag errors that would reasonably matter to an investor (direction, magnitude, metric type, “record” claims, guidance). Avoid nitpicking trivial wording that does not change meaning.\n- Non-duplication: Count each issue under the most relevant criterion to avoid double-penalizing.\n\nEvaluation criteria\n\n- factuality: Are qualitative statements in Company answers accurately reflected and grounded in the transcript?\n- metric_accuracy: Are numerical values and metric types in Company answers correct and not mislabeled? If the transcript is ambiguous and the SUMMARY preserves ambiguity, pass.\n- question_accuracy: Do analyst questions/premises in the SUMMARY faithfully represent what was asked (concise paraphrase allowed)?\n- metric_specificity: Are metrics tied to the correct product/segment/tier/timeframe as stated?\n- question_completeness: Are all materially significant sub-questions from each analyst block included?\n- question_grouping: Are related sub-questions grouped together, and distinct themes separated?\n- answer_completeness: Does the SUMMARY capture all key information from Company answers: quantified metrics/drivers, explicit guidance/outlook, risks/opportunities, notable strategy/management/product changes, customer behavior shifts, explicit sentiment, and when questions were not directly answered?\n\nKey rules and edge cases\n\n- Analyst premises vs Company confirmation: If an analyst asserts “upmarket is flat” and management counters, a SUMMARY quoting this under Q should not be penalized under factuality/metric_accuracy. Evaluate the management counterpoint under answer_completeness and factuality.\n- “Record” claims: Only accept “record” when the transcript explicitly states it for that specific tier/metric. Do not generalize across tiers (e.g., from $100k to $50k).\n- Monetary figures without type: Treat dollar amounts as type-agnostic unless specified. Do not infer ARR/revenue/billings unless the transcript says so. If the SUMMARY adds a qualifier like “cumulative,” accept only if the transcript context reasonably supports it (e.g., mentions “accumulated” revenue/usage) and it does not change the metric type.\n- Non-disclosures: If the company declines to provide a metric (e.g., RPO), a SUMMARY stating “no disclosure/not provided” is acceptable.\n\nProcess\n\n- Read the entire transcript.\n- Build an attribution map of the SUMMARY: tag each clause as Analyst (Q), Company (A), or Meta.\n- Evaluate Q-labeled content for question_accuracy, question_completeness, question_grouping.\n- Evaluate A-labeled content for factuality, metric_accuracy, metric_specificity, answer_completeness.\n- Apply ambiguity and materiality policies before flagging errors.\n- For each failed criterion, include at least one precise error object with:\n  - error: concise explanation\n  - summary_text: exact excerpt from the SUMMARY\n  - transcript_text: an exact, locatable excerpt from the TRANSCRIPT that includes the speaker name and at least ~12 consecutive words or a distinctive, verifiable phrase\n\nOutput rules\n\n- Output ONLY valid JSON using the provided Output Structure template.\n- For passed criteria: \"passed\": true, \"errors\": []\n- For failed criteria: \"passed\": false with one or more error objects.\n- overall_passed = true only if all criteria pass.\n- pass_rate = passed_criteria / total_criteria, rounded to 3 decimals.\n- evaluation_timestamp = current UTC time in ISO 8601 format.\n\nEmpty-input handling\n\n- If any of the tags is empty, stop and output exactly: \"No [<TRANSCRIPT> <SUMMARY> <STRUCTURE>]\" including only the missing tags inside the brackets.##Your output should follow the structure specified in the \"OUTPUT STRUCTURE\" below:\n-If the provided summary successfully meets a criteria, return \"True\" for that criteria.\n-If any information doesn't meet a criteria, respond with \"False\" and provide detailed error information.\n\n## Output Structure\nOutput your response as valid JSON following this exact structure:\n```json\n{OUTPUT_STRUCTURE}\n```\n\nEvery metric in the 'EVALUATION CRITERIAS' should reperesent one dict object in the output.

If the SUMMARY adds a qualifier like “cumulative,” accept only if the transcript context reasonably supports it (e.g., mentions “accumulated” revenue/usage) and it does not change the metric type.\n- Non-disclosures: If the company declines to provide a metric (e.g., RPO), a SUMMARY stating “no disclosure/not provided” is acceptable.\n\nProcess\n\n- Read the entire transcript.\n- Build an attribution map of the SUMMARY: tag each clause as Analyst (Q), Company (A), or Meta.\n- Evaluate Q-labeled content for question_accuracy, question_completeness, question_grouping.\n- Evaluate A-labeled content for factuality, metric_accuracy, metric_specificity, answer_completeness.\n- Apply ambiguity and materiality policies before flagging errors.\n- For each failed criterion, include at least one precise error object with:\n  - error: concise explanation\n  - summary_text: exact excerpt from the SUMMARY\n  - transcript_text: an exact, locatable excerpt from the TRANSCRIPT that includes the speaker name and at least ~12 consecutive words or a distinctive, verifiable phrase\n\nOutput rules\n\n- Output ONLY valid JSON using the provided Output Structure template.If the structure is not provided, follow the structure of the summary\n- For passed criteria: \"passed\": true, \"errors\": []\n- For failed criteria: \"passed\": false with one or more error objects.\n- overall_passed = true only if all criteria pass.\n- pass_rate = passed_criteria / total_criteria, rounded to 3 decimals.\n- evaluation_timestamp = current UTC time in ISO 8601 format.\n\nEmpty-input handling\n\n- If any of the tags is empty, stop and output exactly: \"No [<TRANSCRIPT> <SUMMARY> <STRUCTURE>]\" including only the missing tags inside the brackets.##Your output should follow the structure specified in the \"OUTPUT STRUCTURE\" below:\n-If the provided summary successfully meets a criteria, return \"True\" for that criteria.\n-If any information doesn't meet a criteria, respond with \"False\" and provide detailed error information.\n\n## Output Structure\nOutput your response as valid JSON following this exact structure:\n```json\n{OUTPUT_STRUCTURE}\n```\n\nEvery metric in the 'EVALUATION CRITERIAS' should reperesent one dict object in the output. IMPORTANT:\n- Output ONLY valid JSON, no additional text\n- For passed criteria, set \"passed\": true and \"errors\": []\n- For failed criteria, set \"passed\": false and include detailed error objects in the \"errors\" array\n- Each error object must have \"error\", \"summary_text\", and \"transcript_text\" fields\n- Ensure all JSON strings are properly escaped",
