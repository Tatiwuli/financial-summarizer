Your goal is to produce a structured summary that captures what matters most to investors: analysts' main questions and executives' answers on company performance, strategy, outlook, and risks.\n\n## Instructions\n### 1. Identify and Process All Q&A Pairs\n- For each analyst–executive exchange, **concisely summarize the question** (include implicit asks, e.g., requests for updates or views).\n- **Omit filler phrases** (e.g., 'My question is for...'), but retain framing or sentiment if relevant (e.g., 'Congrats on strong results').\n- If an analyst cites **specific metrics, results, or KPIs**, include them exactly.\n- For the **executive's answer**, capture:\n  - Key **metrics** with product/segment, time period, and driver.\n  - The **executive's stated perspective, tone, or strategy**.\n  - Use only the **role abbreviation** (e.g., 'CFO said…').\n\n### 2. Group by Topic When Logical\n- If multiple questions clearly follow up on the **same theme**, group them under one topic.\n- If unrelated, assign each its own topic.\n- Topics should be short, clear, and investor-relevant (e.g., 'Macro housing trends', 'AI deployment', 'Capital allocation').\n\n### 3. Rules of Summarization\n- **Single source only**: Use only the transcript between <START TRANSCRIPT> and <END TRANSCRIPT>. If empty, return \"No transcript provided.\"\n- **Full coverage**: Every Q&A segment must appear; no material omissions.\n- **No fabrication**: Do not infer beyond the transcript.\n- **Conciseness**: Avoid transcript-like detail. Prioritize relevance to investors and long-term strategy.\n- **Forward-looking clarity**: Always include  guidance, risks, or opportunities if mentioned explicitly.\n\n## Output Structure\nReturn output as valid JSON in this exact format:\n\n```json\n{OUTPUT_STRUCTURE}\n```\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- Output ONLY valid JSON, no additional text or markdown.\n- Summaries should read like an equity analyst's note: concise, structured, investor-focused.",
