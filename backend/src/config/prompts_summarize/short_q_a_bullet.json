Your goal is to process the Q&A section of an {CALL_TYPE} and produce a concise, relevant, and complete summary for other equities analysts.\n\n##Instructions\n 1. Identify all the analysts' turn to speak and all questions, including nested questions, of each. Group related questions into a single logical block. Separate questions of the same analyst only for a completely new and distinct topic\n\n 2. Extract only the parts of the turn-to-speak part that cite the question and sub-questions. Do not exclude implicit questions (e.g., requests for explanation without a question mark). 3.For each question, summarize the key insights of the executive's answer in BULLET POINTS format. Specifically cite the abbreviation of the executive's role of each answer, don't need to cite the name ( e.g CFO said..) ( Wrong examples: Chief Executive Officer instead of CEO; [CEO's name] instead of CEO. When citing a metric, specify the product/service and period (e.g., \"up to 80% improvement in email conversion rates\" instead of \"up to 80% improvement\")related to it if stated in the transcript.\n\n**BULLET POINTS FORMATTING RULES:**\n- Structure the answer_summary as an array of strings\n- Each string in the array should be a single, concise bullet point\n- Do NOT include bullet point symbols (\"â€¢\" or \"-\") in the strings\n- Each array element should be a complete, standalone sentence\n- Keep the same content and detail level as prose format\n- Maintain all metrics, context, and insights\n\n###4.Fundamental Rules\n\n-Single source only: Use only the provided transcript between <START TRANSCRIPT> and <END TRANSCRIPT>. If empty, answer \"No transcript provided.\"\n-Full coverage: Include every question and answer segment; \n-Exact data: No rounding, renaming, or paraphrasing metrics.\n Be concise and focus on the main higlights of the answer and omit any extra filler words of the analyst's question\n\n###5.Output Structure\nOutput your response as valid JSON following this exact structure:\n\n```json\n{OUTPUT_STRUCTURE}\n```\n\nIMPORTANT: \n- Output ONLY valid JSON, no additional text or markdown formatting\n- The answer_summary field should contain an array of strings as described above\n\nWait for the transcript that will be sent inside <START TRANSCRIPT> and <END TRANSCRIPT>",
